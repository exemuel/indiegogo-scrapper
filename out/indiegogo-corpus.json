            "story": "UNAKTI: Soil to Skin\u00a0Soil supports 85% of life on Earth, and human health cannot be protected without the most basic sources of life functioning well. While the world is crumbling around us, we are taking action where is most needed. On a mission to restore human and planetary health, we focus our efforts on ecosystems regeneration, by preserving and recovering our natural resources while shining a light on conscious and 100% clean skincare products of the highest quality.My name is Susana Gago, I come from Spain, and after a career in the corporate world, I decided to pursue a more meaningful life. I moved to India looking for the rare and the unique, and launched my first venture in the sustainability space in 2006 \"Miss monkey\", a slow fashion brand that gained international recognition as a \"hidden luxury brand\".Fast forward, I acknowledge that even sustainability is not enough, and only regenerative practices that can restore our degraded ecosystems can bring the hope and solutions we all need.Although working in India as a woman and an outsider is beyond challenging, we\u2019re doing great things in The Himalayas with a large network of women farmers, and we want to continue with the cultivation of high-value medicinal and aromatic plants via regenerative agroforestry projects and creating by-products for the wider use of ethnomedical, phytopharm and cosmetic industries around the world.By restoring land, we not only combat climate change by feeding the soil, sinking carbon, and attracting greater biodiversity, but also provide food and create income for the remote mountain\u00a0communities we engage with.60% of every product we apply onto our skin, travels through the bloodstream to our internal organs, causing hormonal disruptions that can lead to health issues.Unfortunately, it's extremely rare (if not impossible),\u00a0to find 100% natural, toxin-free products in the market, regardless of their claims.https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/toxic-beauty-poisoning-our-cosmetics-personal-care-products-gago/\nAverage\u00a0grooming routine means we host a staggering 515 different synthetic chemicals in our bodies every single day.\nThese toxins build up over time and can gradually disrupt our hormonal release, break down the immune system and result in disease and health problems.\nOver 25.000 chemicals are marketed with little government intervention.\nUNAKTI productsBy creating waterfree or -anhydrous products, using 100% pure waxes, butters, and oil-soluble actives to replace the aqua, we reduce unnecessary harm to the environment and eliminate the need for synthetic/chemical preservatives.Our products have been lab-tested and certified as 100% natural, never witnessed before by the laboratory conducting the tests.What do our customers sayAnjali Malhotra, plastic surgeon\u00a0\"After about 6 months of using Unakti's Hairbloom oil, the difference in my hair is just phenomenal! Everyone around me has noticed that my hair has actually regrown! My hair was especially thin in the front and I would keep trying inventive ways to comb my hair to hide it. Today, I have thick, luxurious hair! The difference is actually unimaginable! After trying to find a product like thisfor so many years, I\u2019d almost given up hope! This product has been nothing less than miraculous for me. Can\u2019t recommend it highly enough!\"\n\nYuca Devrese, surfer ( Roxy ambassador) \"I was searching for sunscreen without any chemicals, just natural stuff! I\u2019m eating natural food why should I put chemicals on the largest organ (skin) of my body? The color of Unakti's sunscreen is sweet purple, has a lovely smell, and is quite fluid. When I put it on my skin the texture feels thick but when I rub it out it feels like a real protecting layer on my skin, I love this feeling &amp; it\u2019s not sticky. After 2 hours of surfing my skin was not burned at all. After the surf and shower, my skin felt so good &amp; smooth, baby-soft!. Knowing it is natural &amp; no chemicals added I just want to use this lovely chocolate sunscreen every sunny day!\"\n\u00a0\nWe are a fem-powered team, sharing values and the desire to use business as a tool for the common good, bridging the gap between the grassroots and the final customer with total transparency and traceability.\nBy harnessing the power of\u00a0Ayurveda and green nanotechnology, we've fused ancient skincare practices with modern bio-science to create a clean, nature-based, powerful, and effective line of luxury, cruelty-free skincare products, that have been tested over the last 4 years with extraordinary results.And by powering all our processes from the ground up, with 360^ newest technologies, we are building a supply chain that empowers the human and planetary experience, champions stewardship, and creates real change that is equitable, viable, profitable, and scalable.The tide is shifting also in the luxury sector having a brand new set of attributes:\nInside-out wellbeing and balance\nReconnection to the inner-self\nRe-rooting, sense of belonging\nCommunity enhancement\nPreservation of the planet itself\nSince plastic packaging is a leading cause of environmental damage, we have custom-designed, our\u00a0sustainable, reusable, and biodegradable\u00a0packaging and refills, that support biodiversity, currently under R&amp;D.Our campaign GOALWe are raising eu 37000 as the first stepping stone on our fundraising journey. This amount will allow us to set up our legal structure, draft a solid supply chain plan and land assessment,\u00a0prepare a compelling business plan to raise pre-seed funding from investors, and move forward with the research &amp; development of our sustainable and biodegradable packaging, and our 2 first products (bee cream &amp; chocolate sunscreen)A 5% of the amount raised, will be donated to Mount Valley Development Association (MVDA) in The Himalayas, an NGO that works towards improving the livelihoods of rural women.This will help them buy a cold-pressed machine for carrier oils and a steam-distillation machine for essential oils, so they can supply Unakti with some of their amazing ingredients for our cosmetics.Part of the amount raised will allow us to take the next steps towards the seed funding round, to cover the product launch on July 2022, and the first 18-month runway.Whichever amount we raise, will be strategically allocated with priority on legal, product,\u00a0and people, while we move on with our conversations with investors for seed fundingYour support is crucial for our cause, and by supporting us, you\u2019re supporting life.Claim our fantastic rewards below or make your good soul donations.\u00a0All our contributors are invited to a guided visit to our plantations in The Himalayas.All products are to be delivered between February to July 30th following contributions order.If you just can't contribute, but you resonate with our mission, you can help by getting the word out\u00a0using Indiegogo sharing tools."

                "update": "Dear all\nThe campaign has come to an end.\nIt's been quite a revealing experience really.. we have managed to raise between this platform and the one on the malfunctioning Indian platform, some eu 9k.\u00a0Far from the goal, but a small stepping stone.\nThere have been lots of good and bad surprises, as I thought it would. Some people who have compromised to support, didn't at all. Some asked for shares, and Robert Van Gasteren who was in the ambassadors team and had compromised to eu 1000 contribution, even sent a fake payment report. Shocking, yes.\nOn the bright side, it's all of you who have so kindly and generously supported Unakti on this crucial first step. I thank you warmly ???\nNext move is field work in The Himalayas, land assessment and feseability plan. It's now the time for nursery work, and planning.\nI've been contacted by a crowdfunding management computing the US who has proposed a partnership to relaunch a new campaign on commission basis. It would be them doing the hard work this time, preparation, building an audience, campaign content and design, marketing, campaign management and fundraising. Larger goal amount.\nAnyhow, on this chaotic times, Regeneration becomes more important than ever!\nIve been awarded with a scholarship for\"Regenerative Leadership Journey\" by Laura Storm and the pioneers of the Regenerative movement around the world, so very grateful for that too. Really enjoying the course and I hope I get to improve my leadership capabilities for the very challenging future ahead.\nAnd now, I've just received the raw ingredients from my Himalayan supplier to handcraft your wonderful products at my home lab, so I'll get on with it and I'm hoping to be able to send all by the end of March.\nI'll keep you posted by mail, will be sharing some pics &amp; videos with the farmers to keep you in the loop.\nBe vigilant and stay alert, things are not as black and white as they're making us believe. While all these well-oschestrated distractions happen, our freedoms are at high risk. The European Parlament is trying to get all UN &amp; NATO countries to sign up a treaty on pandemic prevention to the WHO. This is beyond anything they've done up to now. Meaning our freedom is been given away. No governments jurisdiction. One global health body. They'll be able to inject into us anything they want, anytime they want.\nWatch our for what's happening behind the scenes.\n\u00a0\nBest wishes and warm hugs\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSusana\n\u00a0"

We've just engaged with a crowdfunding boosting agency instead, which does organic reposting, email campaigns, etc.\nBut hey, values and principles come for us, before profit.\nTherefore, and up to now, I must say that Unakti has proudly spent ZERO on social media advertising.\nWe'll go slow, but we'll take a different route (at least until investment money is raised), then we'll have to see if we can actually maintain this policy.\nMy vision is for Unakti to grow slowly and organically, and to create a by-invite-only platform, in which we can create a vibrant community of like-minded individuals and have enriching discussions, and an array of interesting speakers from the health and wellness space we can learn from, who can guide us towards a more conscious way of living and how to fully regain the full spectrum of our health.\nSo, investing in education, rather than in advertising.\nAs campaign supporters, you'll receive your personal invites to the platform in due time.\nFinally, I'd like to express my deepest gratitude once again for your support. I appreciate you.\n\u00a0\nWe keep walking\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"

We're putting the plan into action\u00a0over the next couple of weeks so stay tuned.\n\u00a0\n$25,000\nThis will allow us to go beyond the 3 initial villages and turn this into a growing movement across Africa. Please help us reach this before the end of the year.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nHelp Preserve the Fountain of Unlimited Health Uniquely Found in Micro Communities Around the World\nIn a few places in the world, the natural state of our perfect health remains.\u00a0 These communities provide a window of what is possible.\u00a0 They show\u00a0that illness (both chronic and immediate) is an unnatural state.\u00a0 However, the health of these communities is under threat.\u00a0\nHumanitarian and environmental efforts have begun to whittle away at their traditional diets and have encroached on their land.\u00a0 The children are being fed a school lunch of water, beans, corn, sugar, and vegetable oil.\u00a0\nIf this continues, we will see the same decline in health that we have seen all over the world.\u00a0 Soon, they too will think that chronic disease and ill-health are normal.\u00a0 At Cows 4 Kids, our mission is to provide the school children with their traditional tribal diet and to help community members preserve their ancient dietary knowledge in a modern setting.\u00a0\nLearn more about the positive impact we have and join us in bringing about Cows 4 Kids!\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nHere at Cows 4 Kids, we find that it is not good enough to reverse disease.\u00a0 We are in the business of stopping it all together.\u00a0 Each of the communities we support consumes a different traditional diet, yet they all maintain perfect health.\u00a0 We provide them with the animals to continue their unique ancestral diets and keep their wisdom alive.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nThe Team\nMary Ruddick, Brian Sanders, and Jay Hanamura\u00a0started Cows4Kids.com after a life changing trip to Tanzania and Uganda.\u00a0 All three founding members have long worked toward reversing disease in the western world.\u00a0 Upon seeing the perfect health of so many villages start to decline, they realized that something had to be done.\u00a0 Cows4Kids\u00a0is a result.\u00a0 Contact us and join the revolution:\nhello@cowsforkids.com\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nWhy We Are Different\u00a0\nThe beauty of giving an animal to a village, is that it is self-sustaining.\u00a0 These animals will have babies that will have babies, providing unlimited generations with nutrient-dense ancestral nourishment.\u00a0 This is not a handout.\u00a0 Further, none of these animals require feed in these regions, as they graze on the wild plants.\u00a0 The communities supported by Cows 4 Kids have a heritage of animal rearing, and already maintain the skills to keep vibrantly healthy animals.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\nMaasai Village\nThe Maasai live in Tanzania in the valley of Kilimanjaro.\u00a0 Their traditional diet includes raw milk, blood, goat meat, beef, and herbal tea.\u00a0 Although the children have their traditional diets at home, they are fed vegetable oil, corn, and beans at school.\u00a0 For this Maasai village, 10 cows and 20 goats are needed for the school to provide a proper Maasai lunch.\n\u00a0\nChagga Village\nThe Chagga live on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.\u00a0 Their traditional diet includes fresh glacial water, milk, butter, goat meat, beef, chicken, fish, eggs, banana, taro, avocado, mango, sorghum, and millet.\u00a0 In the last hundred years, maize has replaced sorghum.\u00a0 With this initiative, our goal is to

cows to feed the children their traditional diet while at school.\u00a0 Currently, they are being fed a gruel comprised of unprocessed maize, beans, and water.\u00a0 For this Chagga village, 20 cows, 30 goats, and 60 chickens are needed.\n\u00a0\nBatwa Village\nThe Batwa are in a unique situation in Uganda, as they have been displaced by the 1991 Bwindi National Park laws.\u00a0 Traditionally living as hunter gatherers, the Batwa have always maintained perfect health.\u00a0 However, as they are now displaced, they can no longer procure their food from hunting, and their health is rapidly declining.\u00a0 They are in urgent need of livestock.\u00a0 For this Batwa village, 20 cows, 50 goats, and 60 chickens are needed.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n$10\u00a0Thank you\nEvery bit

In the future a small stipend may be paid to a trusted employee to manage the project. This will never exceed 3% of the funds raised.

            "story": "\n\u00a0A few years ago, my good friend Richard Tazzara came up with a series of toys, where he inflated plastic figures to extrapolated measures to make them look really large. I\u00a0 liked those toys and now as years have passed, I am inspired to create my own series \u201cFat So What?!\u201d where superheroes from comics are exaggerated to heavy bodies.\u00a0In these times, we embrace each other as we are and encourage love and empathy first. Inclusivity is great, after all \u2013 Santa Claus and Snowman are perfect just the way they are! But where do we draw the line between body positivity and unhealthy lifestyles? Where Is it a personal choice and where is it a consequence of\u00a0social-economical impact?We\u2019re seeing some interesting trends in commercial campaigns within different industries where plus-size models are finally being celebrated in the body positivity movement. But in the other side encouragement to consume unhealthy food is ever present. For many corporations and big businesses sale of these products is the easy obvious way to create millions in profits. But again, it\u2019s in high demand! Here then, another question: how does this demand take place ?Are we deceiving ourselves? Giant corporations like Coca Cola and McDonald\u2019s are the\u00a0 \u00a0sponsors for most of sports events around the world. We all know that usually the least expensive items in the supermarkets are fizzy drinks, frozen foods, and extra sweet delights. Coca Cola costs less than simple purified water. All of these items contain excessive amounts of high fructose corn syrup, potassium, sodium, trans fat, preservatives, who knows what else?Low-income neighborhoods are disproportionately affected by lack of access to healthy foods. Is it a lack of education, social background, local and federal authorities\u2019 interests? It\u2019s not surprising that the main goal of any enterprise is to generate profit, but I believe that the health of\u00a0 people should come first. These thoughts inspired me to create the \u201cFat, So What?!\u201d series to explore the depths of this dilemmas.\u00a0To extend my discourse about excessive consumption in America and other wealthy countries, I\u2019m embarking on a bicycle trip from Mexico to Costa Rica, 2500km! 40 days. I will start pedalling from Acapulco on February 13 and will be arriving in San Jose , Costa Rica on or around March 26th.I\u2019ll Bicycle for equal healthy food access across the world. During this trip, I\u2019ll be meeting a lot of people from rural and underdeveloped urban areas. These regions have scarce access to food distribution. Hence, I would like to unite our forces to show these people some love and care. I\u2019m setting up a fundraising campaign on Indiegogo to raise money that I will donate to individuals and families that I meet during my trip through Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Nicaragua.\u00a02500 kilometers - $2,500 is the goal of the Indigogo campaign.\u00a0In addition, while on the trip, 50% of sales from the \u201cFat, So What?!\u201d series will be donated to this cause as well!The fundraising campaign starts NOW and you have 7 weeks to contribute until the end of my trip. Each dollar that you send, I\u2019m going to give to a person or a family during my trip in the form of cash ,grocery purchases and other goods. I\u2019m sure they will be very happy with this help and I\u2019ll be documenting all of that to share it with you!\u00a0\nLearn more about the series on my Instagram: @denisouch\n\u00a0"

GNHUSA is part of the growing global happiness movement to establish an optimistic, just and practical path forward. The time has come to move beyond the single-focused GDP (Gross Domestic Product) model of production and consumption and focus on holistic measures of well-being.\nIn order to advocate for measures that focus more squarely on well-being, we are launching the first-ever U.S. Happiness Survey, a random-sampled, 50-state survey that asks the basic questions about how people rate their own lives. The US Happiness Survey will follow in the footsteps of the World Happiness Survey, drawing a random sample of respondents from each of the 50 states and then ranking the states based on how happy their residents are.\nIn order for us to conduct this survey, we will be partnering with survey research professionals who will help us make sure our survey meets the scientific rigor of random sampling. We are raising funds to pay these researchers.\n\nWhat We Need\nGross National Happiness USA will be partnering with the research firm\u00a0Prodege. If you contribute to this project, we will make sure to recognize you in the final report we publish on this survey.\n\nThe Impact\nGross National Happiness has hosted happiness conferences, promoted grassroots programs such as the Charter for Happiness\u00a0and World Happiness Day Happiness Dinners, and even hosted a\u00a010,000-mile walk across the country asking over 3,000 people what happiness means to them. This will be the first time we will be conducting a randomized survey of the country, though, making this in some ways our most ambitious project yet.\n\nRisks &amp; Challenges\nSome states are smaller than others, so we will have to work harder to get enough survey questions administered in those states. We are working with Prodege to make sure that we have a good sample from each of the 50 states.\n\nOther Ways You Can Help\nIf you just\u00a0can't contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help. Below are other things you can do to support the cause.\n\nSign up for our newsletter.\nSign the Charter for Happiness.\nFollow us on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0Twitter.\n\n"

My name is Ishle Yi Park and I am a mother, gardener, hula dancer with Halau Hula Ka Makani Hali 'Ala O Puna, lomi lomi practitioner, certified yoga teacher, award~winning writer, and the first woman to be named Poet Laureate of Queens, New York. For the past 12 years, I've been blessed to\u00a0live in Hawai'i, and my campaign is to help raise funds to purchase land on the Big Island\u00a0where we can live and create a healing center, artists' residency and food forest for our island community.\n\u200bBecome Part of Our Dream!\nWith your collective help, we can grow and build a sanctuary here on the islands where artists can come to rest, renew and recharge their creative batteries, as well as give back to da 'aina with regenerative, sustainable, and organic gardening practices. We invite you to join the collective movement to co~create a healthier, more natural and abundant tomorrow for our keiki with your actions today!\u00a0\n*\nCurated by poet, musician, mama, and educator\u00a0Ishle Yi Park, Gardens of Eatin\u2019 Artists Sanctuary is an BIPOC artists\u2019 residency in Hawai\u2019i open to local &amp; visiting artists and invited guests.The sanctuary will be\u00a0composed of an organic garden, herbal medicine wheel, two round garden studios for short~term artist residencies, BIPOC eco~poetics reading room, yoga &amp; lomi lomi massage room, smoothie, cacao and tea bar and recording studio ~ will be open to artists who are granted residencies in the garden studios.\n\nWhat We Need &amp; What You Get\nLet me break it down for ya'll\u00a0in more detail:\n\nWhat We Need: While we already have some seed money to start, the funds raised from this campaign will go towards ensuring that we purchase\u00a0a large enough land for this vision ~ ideally a 1-3 acre parcel of partially cleared land so that we can start building and growing as soon as possible. We already have an ideal\u00a0location\u00a0on our radar and are in talks with real estate agents about this property, which is why time is of the essence.Funds will\u00a0also go towards building our first three\u00a0round structures, one for my family, one for the healing room (massage &amp; lomi lomi),\u00a0and one for the artist / guest residency, and the solar,\u00a0water, and plumbing for these hales.Additional funds will go towards land clearing, hot tub, and planting seeds, starts &amp; trees for our medicine wheels, lei and la'au la'pa'au gardens and permaculture food forest with a focus on native plants. You are welcome to bless us with funds for specific trees if you like ~ i.e., if you want to fund the planting of a koa tree, or a mango tree, you can do that, or if you'd like to bless us with enough to get an entire yurt ~ wonderful! It's up to you how you give ~ all blessings graciously accepted with gratitude &amp; aloha.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat You Get: If you give us funds for a mango tree, we will allow you to come visit &amp; eat da fruit from this tree when it eventually fruits! You will be first in line to learn about our retreats &amp; offerings on this property, and will be given opportunities to participate in the growth of this center as it unfolds!As contributors, donors, angels &amp; patrons of the arts, you are welcome to visit Lani's Gardens of Eatin' Artists' Sanctuary when you are on the Big Island once it is complete.\u00a0 Here is what the full vision for the land includes &amp; what you can enjoy:\u00a0\u00a0Lani\u2019s Smoothie, Tea &amp; Cacao Cafe &amp; Library:\u00a0will feature Lani's delicious organic smoothies, teas, and cacao elixirs, sell artworks made by artists in residency &amp; provide a lending library of quality books for children &amp; adults.\u00a0\nKhaya ~ House of Song Music Studio : Artists in residence and other local musicians may work &amp; record in this humble yet professional quality round music studio yurt that\u00a0will feature music created to offer soothing benefits to listeners (some of this music will be created &amp; recorded in the music studio).SOL Space for Performances, Salons &amp; Acoustic Concerts, and Farm~to~Table Meals ~\u00a0\u00a0A Community space will be designed for dinners &amp; acoustic concerts, readings, intimate gatherings &amp; community workshops.\nArtist Residency Studios:\u00a0Designed to serve artists, activists, musicians, and front~line cultural workers, these round short term artists residency spaces would host 1-2 artists at a time. Artists will have access to the music studio for recording &amp; performance.\nOrganic Vegetable Garden: A good portion of the \u2018Aina will be dedicated to abundant organic vegetable &amp; herb gardens, including an herbal medicine wheel, a lei garden &amp; la\u2019au la pa\u2019au\u00a0garden. We also envision a permaculture paradise with edible fruits &amp; flowers. The garden will be tended by Lani, her Ohana &amp; resident artists, and volunteers.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Impact\nThis artists\u2019 residency &amp; healing center is designed to serve a very real need among Hawaii, mainland &amp; international BIPOC musicians, artists, and cultural workers &amp; allies, by providing artist~led space to gather, share ideas, and practice regenerative gardening. Our vision is to make this 'aina be a valuable resource for local Hawaiian healers and hula dancers from local halaus like\u00a0Halau Hula Ka Makani Hali 'Ala O Puna\u00a0to harvest medicine and traditional hula regalia for ceremony, as well as for our children and our children's children to enjoy the fruits of our farming, and a space where artists &amp; musicians can come to gather, celebrate, connect &amp; give back to\u00a0the natural world.\u00a0\nHere are some of the things that I'm envisioning on this land:\n-writing workshops\n-hula &amp; yoga classes\n-organic cooking workshops\n-lomi lomi sessions\n-marketing consultations\n-gardening &amp; coconut weaving workshops\n- Hawaiian culture workshops from Hawaiian elders\u00a0\n-workshops for na keiki o ka 'aina (children)\u00a0\n-music studio for community\n-\u00a0and a round yurt (traditional Mongolian style, to pay respect to my ancestors)\u00a0that would be available for local &amp; visiting artists, friends, and family.\u00a0\n*In the past, I have served as the Arts-In-Education Director of the Asian American Writers' Workshop, the Artist in Residence at Youth Speaks, and have been a creative writing &amp; music teacher, poet, activist organizer for over 20 years.\u00a0 I studied massage at the Hawaii Healing Arts School in Oahu, and lomi lomi with Kumu Dane Silva, and am certified in hot stones and detox massage. I received my 200 RYT Yoga Certification from Cloud Nine Yoga at Hawaiian Sanctuary.I have created numerous flourishing gardens from scratch on private farms and estates here on the Big Island when I have worked as a property manager, gardener, woofer, and work~trader, and I have a Certification in Sustainable Farming from Kauai Community College and recently completed the FAM (Farm Apprentice Mentorship) Program at UH Maui, learning from Maui's best organic farmers, so this vision is in total alignment with my life's purpose, which is to create a safe space for learning, growth, creativity, healing and the flourishing of nature.\u00a0It is time I put all of these skills to practical use to serve my ohana and my community and help green the earth ~ \"seed by seed, tree by tree\", as I sing in my song,\u00a0'Aloha 'Aina'. I am committed to this vision which I have held dear to my heart for over a decade, and\u00a0given recent world events, it is absolutely crucial and necessary for us, ESPECIALLY as mothers, Asian Americans, and people of color,\u00a0to have food sovereignty and to learn how to self~sustain and live independently from a system that does not always nourish or sustain us in healthy or positive ways.It is up to us to learn from our ancestors and remember &amp; recreate a\u00a0way of living more in harmony and balance with the earth, which is of course, an ancient way ~ a return to roots and a simpler way of co~existing with our natural world. With God's help and the help of our beloved community, near and far ~ we trust that we can mana~fest this vision for the greater good.\u00a0\n\nOf course, we will naturally encounter risks and obstacles\u00a0on the way to achieving our goal.One thing we do not want is too many chefs in the kitchen making this complicated,\u00a0so for this reason,\u00a0we will keep it small &amp; family run,\u00a0so\u00a0Gardens of Eatin\u2019 Artists\u2019 Sanctuary and SOL will not be co-operatively curated or managed or long term housing for other artists or tenants. It will be a gathering space for musicians, artists, activists &amp; creatives, and a site for healing &amp; planning\u00a0retreats that serves API,\u00a0BIPOC, native Hawaiian\u00a0artists, activists, musicians, local families and traditional\u00a0healers &amp; builders.\u00a0I am confident that with hard work, focus, prayer, communication, and aloha, we can\u00a0overcome any\u00a0hurdles that appear\u00a0in our path.

However many don't realize anyone can have adverse reactions to buildings with high levels of mold contamination. Research has shown\u00a0that water damaged buildings often cause major impacts to health and well being. What isn't always so clear -- is how to return a contaminated building to a normal safe, healthful and nurturing environment. Currently the conventional wisdom is that hard surfaced items with settled spores or fungal fragments can easily be cleaned. But many questions remain.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nAuthor &amp; Researcher - John C. Banta\nCertified Industrial Hygienist and Author John Banta has worked professionally for the last 30 years investigating indoor environmental quality problems in homes and work environments. His first book\u00a0Prescriptions for a Healthy House:\u00a0A Practical Guide for Architects, Builders and Homeowners\u00a0was co-authored with Architect Paula Baker-LaPorte and MD Erica Elliott and is now in its third edition. John is\u00a0currently working on a new\u00a0book --Mold Controlled: A Practical\u00a0Guide to Find, Avoid, and Fix Mold Problems in Water Damaged Homes. \u00a0The book is aimed at demystifying mold problems\u00a0and how to return mold contaminated housing to the nurturing healthful environments we should have as home.\n\nThe Research\nThe funds raised by this campaign will support science based research to answer a\u00a0number of important remaining issues:\u00a0\n\nCan soft furnishings be effectively cleaned to remove mold spores, fungal fragments, and mycotoxins (toxins\u00a0produced by mold)?\nWhich\u00a0cleaning methods are effective, and which\u00a0are\u00a0not?\nWhen should a contaminated mattress, sofa or other upholstered furnishing\u00a0be discarded?\nAre barrier covers such as those for dust mites effective in preventing re-contamination?\u00a0\nCan barrier covers be used to\u00a0provide protection when used on an already contaminated mattress?\n\nIn 2012 the\u00a0Journal of Asthma, 49:139\u2013143 Published a study:\u00a0\"Daily Vacuuming of Mattresses Significantly Reduces House Dust Mite Allergens, Bacterial Endotoxin, and Fungal \u03b2-Glucan.\" This study concluded \"Daily vacuuming of mattresses significantly decreased levels of house dust mite allergens, endotoxin, and Fungal \u03b2-glucan. This method offers sensitized patients a cheaper option to reduce their exposure to bio-contaminants in their bed.\"\nThere are a number of questions that were not answered by the study:\n\nFungal \u03b2-glucan is found in the cell wall of molds. It is not specific to molds associated with water damage. Your\u00a0contribution to\u00a0this crowd-funding venture would be used to test for water damage associated molds using mold specific DNA (MSQPCR).\nThe study tested mattresses\u00a0were HEPA vacuumed daily at a rate of one minute per square meter for eight weeks. At the end of the eight weeks the daily vacuuming had reduced the levels of dust mites, endotoxins and fungal glucans\u00a0by approximately 85%. The study supported by your contribution would help answer the mold question using MSQPCR.\nAfter the daily vacuuming was stopped\u00a0the mattresses continued being monitored. Six weeks later the levels of allergenic dusts had returned to the pre-study levels. The contributions from\u00a0this crowd-funding venture would be used to attempt to determine if levels climbed because high levels of the contaminated dust remained in the home and re-infested the mattress\u00a0or if contaminants were buried deep in the mattress and re-worked their way to the surface.\n\nIt is estimated $1,650\u00a0of funds raised by this campaign would pay for laboratory analysis for one round of testing on one mattress.\n\nUse of Extra Funds if the Project is Over-Funded\nIf this project is over-funded the extra contributions from\u00a0this crowd-funding venture would be used for replicate studies, additional research and book production costs as follows:\n\nThe original study did not address mycotoxins. Is\u00a0HEPA vacuuming effective in removing\u00a0mycotoxins from contaminated fabrics, mattresses\u00a0and upholstered furnishings?\nIf HEPA vacuuming is not effective for mattresses and upholstered furnishings, are there other effective methods that can be used?\nIf preliminary studies show that mold contaminated porous furnishings can be successfully restored, the studies will need to be replicated enough times to be sure that the results are real and not a fluke!\nIt is easy to decide what to do with gypsum walls that have visible growth, but how much extra material should be removed and discarded beyond the visible growth to be sure that actual growth has been eliminated?\nProduction costs for the book could include professional editing, illustrations, salaries, layout and design.\n\n\n\nWhat We Need &amp; What You Get\nThe MSQPCR panel used is known as ERMI. It measures the quantities of DNA identified for thirty-six\u00a0specific genotypes of molds. Laboratory charges for the ERMI panel is $300 per sample. Predominant molds can be analysed as a panel for $150 for a panel of any five of the identified molds.\u00a0\nStudy One (We met our funding goal for Phase 1 of this study. The results have been posted on the secure Contributor Login section of my website)\nThe first study\u00a0replicated the eight week mattress study using MSQPCR to identify the molds found in dust that can be vacuumed from the surface. The dust will be collected before cleaning begins and at two week intervals for the eight weeks of the study. The pre-study sample and the sample collected at the eighth week were\u00a0analysed using the full\u00a0ERMI panel. Samples collected at week 2, 4 and 6 were\u00a0analysed for the most predominant water damage related species identified at the beginning of the study. After the eight weeks of vacuuming the mattress had\u00a0core samples collected at depths of two, four, six, and eight inches for analysis of the predominant water damage related species deep in the cleaned mattress.\nStudy Two (Part one of the barrier cloth study has been funded and completed and posted in the Contributor Login section of my website, additional funds are needed for phase 2 which will repeat the study with barrier cloths that have been laundered)\nThis second study was\u00a0able to capitalize on the first study since the mold contamination types and quantities were\u00a0already determined by the pre-study MSQPCR sample. The effectiveness of multiple types of barrier cloths was\u00a0be tested by placing the barrier on the contaminated mattress and determining the types and quantities of molds that were able to be\u00a0vacuumed through the barrier cloth. The dust that was vacuumed through the barrier was\u00a0be analysed using the same MSQPCR analysis used by the pre-study samples. The results showed that Dust Mite Barriers also help reduce mold contamination - but one type was superior to all the rest!\nStudy Three\u00a0(If this campaign is over-funded)\nThe third study would be performed based on available funds and the identification of potential mycotoxin producing organisms in the mattresses.\u00a0This third study will be able to capitalize on the first study since the mold contamination types and quantities will have already been determined by the pre-study MSQPCR sample. In those cases where one or more organisms that are capable of producing\u00a0a\u00a0target mycotoxins is present the actual level of mycotoxins present in the mattress would then be determined\u00a0prior to and after an interval of HEPA vacuuming. Each mycotoxin test is $300 per sample. In addition to determining if mycotoxins could be removed from a mattress, layer testing would be used to determine the penetration of mycotoxins within the mattress. This study is currently on hold - until we find a mattress contaminated with mycotoxins that can be used.\nAdditional Studies May Be Suggested by the Results of the First Studies\u00a0(If this campaign is over-funded)\nInformation about additional studies are posted in the Updates section of this site.\nResearch projects almost always result in additional questions. If the campaign is over-funded these additional studies can also\u00a0be performed.\nWhat You Get\nEvery contributor of $25 or more will be a part of our inner circle. This means you will be sent research updates that will \u00a0keep you informed about the research findings as they become available. You will also have access to the Mold Controlled\u00a0book chapters as they are produced. You won't have to wait for formal publication to receive the information.\u00a0\nThis will help insure you have access to the most up-to-date mold remediation information available. You will continue to have on-line access to the book in draft form until your copy of the e-book is published and emailed to you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe Impact\nPrevious studies have left many unanswered questions about whether cleaning porous contents such upholstered furnishings and mattresses can be effective. Some methods are likely to work better than others and some measures may only be temporary. It is important for mold sensitive persons to know what methods of cleaning are effective and what methods are not. This will help people determine reasonable expectations for what can be achieved. In a number of cases people have discarded and replaced contaminated items, only to have the contamination reappear in brand new furnishings. Knowing which temporary measures are effective, such as barrier cloths will also help establish a temporary safe environment while decisions are made regarding remediation or relocation.\n\u00a0\n\nRisks &amp; Challenges\nSubmission for Publication in a Peer Reviewed Journal\nMost peer reviewed publications do not permit prior publication. As a contributor, you will be a part of the inner circle, so we will be able to keep you informed with progress updates as the studies\u00a0move\u00a0forward, but the formal publication of the book Mold Controlled will need to be delayed until after the research studies\u00a0have been completed, peer reviewed and appeared in the selected journal(s). Journals typically do not want researchers to submit their findings to more than one publication at a time. Additional delays can occur whenever a journal rejects a submission and during the editing and peer review process. Further delays may occur when peer reviewers request additional information,\u00a0reject content\u00a0or request that submissions be rewritten. It is estimated this process could require two years before the published studies can be referenced in the book. As a contributor you will be provided an access code that you can use to review the draft chapters, and illustrations of the book as they are posted. Combined with routine research updates - this will help insure you have access to the most up-to-date mold remediation information available. You will continue to have on-line access to the book in draft form until your copy of the e-book is published and emailed to you.\u00a0\n\u00a0"

                "update": "I have now posted the Ultimate Chapter on Contents Cleaning and Restoration for mold.\u00a0 I believe the information in these chapters as a whole provides the most comprehensive information about our things and how to prevent, remediate, restore and preserve the items we own when they are affected by water damage, mold growth, settled spores and fragments. If you have yet to contribute - what are you waiting for? If you have already contributed $25 or more, you already know that the information in my chapters is level-headed and practical. If internet advice has you in a panic, now you have access to the following Chapters regarding Mold and our personal contents.\u00a0\n-- Contents Cleaning and Restoration: This is the Newest Chapter. It goes in depth into the nature of our things and how to clean or address mold that has grown or settled on our things.\u00a0\n-- About Our Things: You don't have to throw it all out! This chapter will help you decide how to stage, store and break the cycle of mold contamination on personal possessions whether you are moving, or putting your home back together after a mold disaster.\n-- Cleaning Products: There is no need to spend a fortune on fancy mold cleaners. This chapter will help you understand what cleaners work and how to judge them for yourself. It also addresses the fallacy that killing mold makes it okay.\u00a0\n-- Microfiber Cleaning Cloths: Forget about using rags to clean. Microfiber cloths will significantly reduce the amount of work and do a better job. This chapter covers how to decide if you should be using disposable or reusable Microfiber Cleaning Cloths and how to maintain them.\n-- Laundry &amp; Dry Cleaning: Removing mold contamination from most washables is easy - if you know how. When you finish this chapter - you will know how.\n-- Moldy Mattresses: This chapter is largely based on research completed with your contributions. In it I explain what causes mattresses to become moldy and how to protect them and you from contamination.\n-- Washers &amp; Dryers: This Chapter tells you more than you ever thought you needed to know about washers and clothes dryers. These tools are real work horses when it comes to cleaning up mold in our things - but they only work if you know how to use them properly and effectively.\n-- Vehicles: Many of us spend a lot of time in our car. This chapter tells you how to select, maintain and remediate mold in vehicles.\u00a0\nThank you again for your support and the positive feedback you have provided.\nJohn C. Banta"

                "update": "Here we are in a new year! Progress on the book continues to be at a much slower rate than I had ever anticipated. Approximately half is now posted in the Contributor Login section at my website at www.JohnCBanta.com, another quarter is mostly finished but undergoing the addition of some minor amounts of material and editing. The final quarter either remains to be written or needs major work. My current projection and goal is to have these other sections completed and posted by the middle of the year.\nI am pleased to announce I have posted another chapter. This one is on vehicles. Here is the opening paragraph followed by the Chapter Subheadings:\nVehicles present special issues since they frequently get wet. In general, they are made from materials that are free of nutrients that support growth; however, the various things we transport such as carboard, paper, spilled foodstuff and tracked dirt may provide enough to allow growth if they get and stay wet. Cross contamination by transporting unprotected contaminated items may transfer sufficient spores and fragments to also make the passenger compartment unacceptable for mold sensitive persons. Fortunately, most of the problems can be avoided or corrected by choosing an automobile, van or truck that is easy to service and maintain. When choosing a car for ease of maintenance consider:\n-- Carpeted floor mats tend to hold and hide dirt making them more difficult to clean than hard surfaced flooring. If present, carpet floor mats should be easy to remove and replace for cleaning.\n-- Leather or vinyl seats are easier to effectively clean than soft porous materials.\n-- Efficient cabin air filters should be present and easy to service and maintain. They should filter both the incoming outdoor air and also filter recirculated vehicle cabin air.\n-- The vehicles Air Conditioning (AC) system should completely drain condensate from the vehicle when it is parked on level ground.\n-- The AC system coils and condensation collection pan should be easy to access for inspection and cleaning.\nThe following are the headings in this Chapter:\n-- Cleaning Vehicles with Settled Spores and Fragments\n-- Mold Growth in Vehicles\n-- Preventing Mold Growth in Vehicles\n-- Rapidly Drying Wet Vehicles\n-- Remediating Existing Mold Growth from VehiclesRecognizing Flooded Vehicles\n-- Cabin Air Filter Replacement\n-- Keeping a Vehicles AC System Dry When Not in Use\n\u00a0"

                "update": "About six months ago several colleagues shared that they suspected gypsum dust from wallboard could cause inhibition of the DNA results from ERMI analysis.\nDuring my earlier inhibition study of 21 potential DNA inhibitors (See January 24, 2019 update) I had tested a sample of gypsum dust from wallboard and did not find any evidence of inhibition. Of course, different manufactures use different sources and recipes for their products. Based on the information from my colleagues, I felt it was important to figure out if gypsum wallboard dust can interfere with ERMI (MSQPCR) analysis of mold DNA.\nWhat I have found is that my colleagues were correct! Some gypsum wallboard dust does cause inhibition of DNA analyzed using MSQPCR. I believe this may be at least in part because gypsum wallboard may contain varying amounts of clay. The published literature is quite clear that clay binds with the DNA and prevents its analysis using PCR.\u00a0\nThis has very important implications for post remediation sampling of homes using ERMI. The presence of clay in any residual gypsum dust, or from other sources, may interfere with the identification of remaining mold contamination. This could make it appear that a home has been successfully remediated when it has not! This further demonstrates the importance that laboratories analyzing for ERMI use quality control measures to help ensure that inhibition is being tested for with every sample analysis they perform and that when inhibition is found the sample results are noted as being inhibited so that nobody falsely assumes that the remediation efforts have been successful.\n\u00a0Your support and contributions to Mold Research continue to allows us to fund studies necessary to help resolve some of the important issues regarding investigation of mold contamination in homes.\nThank you for your continued support!\nJohn C.

            "story": "\nSummary\nWebsite: cerealfordinner.org\u00a0\nI am Emily, and I am\u00a0an expert. Not the kind of expert I thought I'd be growing up, when I had plans to become a pediatrician (maybe an opera singer on the side). After my second year of medical school, I began an intensive \"study\" with depression, soon gaining \"expert status.\" I felt so exhausted and\u00a0deeply despondent\u00a0that seemingly simple activities, such as making a sandwich, walking down the stairs, or taking out the trash required tremendous amounts of effort. Singing, an activity that had always brought me great joy and reprieve, had become a chore, reminding me of how far I had deviated from who I once was. Eventually, I made the decision to leave medical school, as my \"depressive studies\" left me little ability keep up with the rigors of medical training.\n\n*Emily's natural habitat\nThroughout my journey I've been consistently bombarded with messages from websites, doctors, and family to exercise (vigorously, 3-4 times/week),\u00a0eat well (Mediterranean diet is most effective),\u00a0find a fulfilling career/passion and a supportive community to belong to. This, combined with medications and therapy, would help to alleviate my depression and I would achieve Ultimate Recovered Patient Status. My name would basically be in lights at my therapist's office.\u00a0\n\nI am very aware that\u00a0suggestions are all evidence-based and well-meaning. However, the problem with the depressed mind is that 1. we often have so little hope of getting better that we don't even want to try anymore, or 2. we just don't care about ourselves at all, or 3. we want to get better but have no clue where to start.\u00a0A depressed person needs specific resources for\u00a01. how to simply get by when they are at their worst and 2. how to start moving toward wellness in a realistic, achievable way.\nCereal for Dinner is an online platform that provides these resources. It \"meets you where you're at\" by stratifying resources based on how you're doing. Need easy recipes that you can make in ~5 min just so that you're eating something? Use the \"depression-friendly\" recipe directory that offers filters based on effort level, implements used, etc. Do you currently have a job but need to figure out how to get by during a depressive episode? Check out that section in the \"Occupational/Educational\" section.\n\u00a0\n16.1 million people are diagnosed with depression each year, and this is only growing with the pandemic.\u00a0We as a society need to not only offer affordable, culturally-competent care (see the Care Access page), but we also need to ensure that individuals with depression are equipped with the resources to cope\u00a0with the disease and take attainable\u00a0steps to get better. Cereal for Dinner does just that.\n\u00a0\n\nWhat We Need &amp; What You Get\nYour contribution will go toward the following initiatives:\u00a0\n\nContinuing to expand and update resources on the existing Cereal for Dinner website\nRecognizing that one's experience with depression can be vastly different than another's, especially among individuals from systemically underserved backgrounds, we are committed to creating an Advisory Team with a diversity of lived experiences, backgrounds, and identities.\nMarketing initiatives (including SEO and Google ads) to ensure the website reaches as many people as possible\nDevelopment of a corresponding app, which will:\nOffer community forums based on the resources offered and user interest, in order to build community\nDevelop a group chat program, where users can speak with clinicians and/or peers about topics that are rarely offered, such as Coping with Treatment-Resistant Depression, Keeping Up with Hygiene, and Living with Depression When You're Struggling Financially\nCreate a weekly live community meeting, where a speaker can tell their story and offer hope to those who are struggling, along with a community meditation breakout discussions\nOffer depression-specific, evidence-based tracks led by experts which will assist the user in developing wellness goals in a step-wise format\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Impact\nCereal for Dinner has the capacity to assist thousands, if not millions of individuals living with depression and in-need of extra support, with its website alone. Its future corresponding app will allow for future engagement community, validation, and hope. So many have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and many have been struggling with depression/bipolar depression for many years before the pandemic began. Your contribution will be essential for creating a new way of looking at depression care, and assisting those who are \"depression experts\" like me.\n\u00a0\n\nRisks &amp; Challenges\nRisk #1:\u00a0Not having the funding to sustain the projects in store for Cereal for Dinner.\u00a0\nHow It's Being Addressed:\u00a0\n\nUtilizing existing network of mental health professionals that I have worked with in a professional capacity in the past.\nReaching out to relationships with existing popular mental health forums and newsletters.\nCurrently applying for a number of incubator programs that assist startups in thinking through challenges and gathering an appropriate team of experts to give us the best chance for success\n\nRisk #2: I have never run an organization of this magnitude before.\nHow It's Being Addressed:\n\nI am fortunate to work with an incredibly talented and experienced Advisory\u00a0Team with vast knowledge of mental health and entrepreneurship, such as the Associate Chief Medical Officer of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the former Director of Psychological Services at the University of Pennsylvania, to name a few.\u00a0\nThis is not my first foray into running organizations in the mental health field. At the University of Pennsylvania, I founded the school's first in-person peer counseling program, Penn Benjamins, which is still running 7 years later,\u00a0and at Brown Medical School I assisted in running the free clinic and founded their first free psychiatry clinic.\nI assisted with starting up the first pediatric non-profit in Massachusetts, Boston Community Pediatrics.\nI have a degree in Health &amp; Societies from the University of Pennsylvania, a Masters in Medical Science from Brown, and am nearly finished with an additional Masters in Population Medicine, so I have experience with\u00a0population-based solutions to health problems.\n\n\nOther Ways You Can Help\nIf you are unable to donate, there are many ways you can help:\n\nIf you have any particular skill that may be relevant to Cereal for Dinner that you'd be willing to donate your time to (i.e. social media (!!), SEO, resource gathering, web design, app design, etc.)\nWe will likely be starting a blog in the near future, and would welcome contributions.\nYou could share this campaign with friends/colleagues:\u00a0Facebook:\u00a0Cereal For Dinner, Instagram:\u00a0@cerealfordinner.official, Twitter:\u00a0@cereal4dindin, LinkedIn:\u00a0Cereal for Dinner\n\n"

With your help, we were able to raise HALF the requested amount in 48 hours alone!\u00a0\nAnyone who has talked to me for &gt;10 min knows I'm not the most, um, forthcoming when it comes to anything vulnerable, so sharing my story with the world was basically my worst nightmare, but also something I felt needed to happen. For all those out there with depression like me, who have felt ashamed of themselves for not being able to do more and utterly alone in their experience. By giving to this campaign, you are saying 'I hear you, I see you, and I accept you as you are.' May we continue to spread this message to those around us who are struggling.\n\u00a0\nAlong those lines, let's keep up this awesome momentum! Please feel free to share this campaign link, the website link (cerealfordinner.org), and tag/follow/share on social media:\u00a0\nFacebook: Cereal For Dinner, Instagram: @cerealfordinner.official, Twitter: @cereal4dindin, LinkedIn: Cereal for Dinner\nPlease message me (ederecktor@gmail.com), if you would like an email/post template to make things a bit easier.\u00a0\nThank you again for your support.

            "story": "EMPOWER YOUR CAREER... and\u00a0the Careers of Vets, Minority Students, and 1st Generation College StudentsCAREER CLARIFIER is a revolutionary career clarity test developed to help college students and graduates (in all stages of their careers) quickly identify their best career options so they can have jobs they love and achieve their professional potential.We also have an audacious social impact goal to support the career success of\u00a0100,000 college students who are either veterans, attending a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) or Hispanic Serving Institute (HSI), or are the 1st person in their family to attend college (1st generation college student).That\u2019s where you come in. We need your backing to launch our new career clarity test.\u00a0For every test we sell, our social mission is to provide a free career clarity test\u00a0to a veteran, student of color, 1st generation college student\u00a0to help them achieve the professional success and financial self-sufficiency they want and deserve.\u00a0\u00a0WHAT PROBLEM DOES CAREER CLARIFIER SOLVE?Despite spending tens of thousands of dollars (or more) on their college education, more than half of college graduates don\u2019t know what career they would enjoy and excel in. Many take whatever job they land after graduating, and often waste years (or decades) of their life\u00a0stuck in unfulfilling jobs.Career Clarifier is unlike any other career test. Here\u2019s why: All the popular career tests today suggest careers primarily based on personality. The flaw with that methodology is that personality determines HOW we do our job but not WHAT job we should do.Think for a moment about the sharks on the hit tv show Shark Tank. They all have the same job - business leader and investor- but their personalities are wildly different.Instead of personality, it\u2019s their ability to size up an entrepreneur, analyze a market, understand the financials of a business, and structure a profitable deal.\u00a0 It\u2019s their skills, knowledge, and abilities that make them great at their careers.Career Clarifier, unlike other career tests, primarily uses a person\u2019s skills, knowledge, and interests (and a bit of personality) to identify career options that truly fit.Our career clarity test is the perfect solution for:\nStudents in university / college getting ready for the working world\nA recent college grad still looking for the right\u00a0job / career\nA not-so-recent college grad feeling stuck in their career\u00a0\nExperienced working professionals looking to make a career transition\u00a0\nHigh school students thinking about what they want to major in during college\n\u00a0\u00a0THIS CAMPAIGN\u00a0ADDRESSES A CRITICAL SOCIAL PROBLEMMost\u00a0college students and graduates don't know about the\u00a01,000+ different careers that exist.While veterans, people of color, and 1st generation college students have big dreams and strong motivation, they typically have less knowledge of the professional careers available to them to help them achieve their full potential. Many will get stuck in unsatisfying jobs that don\u2019t let them achieve their potential.That\u2019s why for each career test we sell at Career Clarifier, we will donate a career test to a veteran who is enrolled in college, a student at an HCBU or HSI, or a 1st generation college student.When you back this campaign, you\u2019ll be helping people you know personally who need\u00a0career support, and we will be able to provide the Career Clarifier to three traditionally underserved populations so they can have inspiring careers and be heroes to people in their communities.Because of your support, they will be the example that other people will look to and think,\u00a0\u201cI can do that with my career too.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CAREER CLARIFIER IS EASY TO USEPeople can use their computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone to answer 80 multiple choice questions about skills, knowledge, and interests.Our proprietary platform will compare their answers to an in-depth analysis of more than 1,000 jobs and careers geared toward people with college degrees. Each test taker instantly receives a comprehensive, 90-page results report, which can be saved, downloaded and/or printed.The personalized results report includes:\nThe test taker's preferred skills, knowledge, and abilities\n20 specific jobs and careers that best\u00a0fit the test taker\nComprehensive Career Summary Profiles that describe each recommend job\nDetailed information on how to evaluate the career options and choose the best one\nWork settings the test taker will enjoy working in based on their interests\nHow to choose the right career for you\n\u00a0ABOUT METhe past 17 years of my life have been dedicated to helping college students and college graduates to identify their best career options, so they don\u2019t waste years of their life job hopping from one unsatisfying job to another.In 2004, I founded\u00a0a career clarity coaching service that helps college students and college graduates to identify their best career options. More than 7,000 people have used my 1 to 1 coaching service to identify career paths they will enjoy, excel in and be proud of.For the past two years, I have been building a revolutionary online career clarity test that will provide career clarity to people who don\u2019t have access to expensive 1 to 1 career coaching.Working with a technical co-founder, we\u2019ve designed and built a proof-of-concept model that has been tested and fine-tuned with more than 500 of my clients. I\u2019ve gotten their feedback and suggestions on how to improve our system and results report.I\u2019ve also spent the past eighteen months writing comprehensive summary profiles for more than 1,000 careers to help users learn the details about each recommended option. The career clarity test is set for October 1, 2021 release.I\u2019ve been self-funding all this work and product development. It\u2019s an investment I feel privileged and proud to have been able to make.Now, I need your help. \u00a0The more we raise, the more tests we can provide right now. Ultimately, our goal is to provide 100,000 free tests.\u00a0\u00a0FOUR WAYS YOU CAN HELP LAUNCH THIS REVOLUTIONARY CAREER CLARITY TESTIf empowering the career success of people you know, as well as traditionally underserved people, moves you, here are four things you can do today:\nBack this campaign now: Get a career test for you (or someone you know) and provide a career clarity test a veteran, student\u00a0of color, or\u00a01st generation college student.\nHelp a friend: Please share this link with friends who\u00a0would benefit from career guidance.\nHelp spread the word: Share this project with someone you know who is also passionate about seeing underserved people succeed.\nHelp us get media exposure: Share this project with your media contacts.\n\u00a0WHAT YOUR GENEROSITY WILL DOYour generosity will help unleash the career potential of\u00a0graduating veterans, minority students, and 1st generation college students.\u00a0\u00a0With your generosity, you'll receive a career clarity test that you (or someone you know) can take... and we will donate a free career clarity test to help them see their best career possibilities and achieve their full personal and professional potential.You and I have the power to use our influence and financial resources for good - and in this case, to make a difference in the lives of so many others.\u00a0Thank you!\u00a0 Thank you!\u00a0 Thank you!\u00a0"

            "story": "\n\u00a0\nHello, my name is Alyssa Taylor, and I am currently a three month resident artist at the Baltimore Jewelry Center, and creator of Arm\u00f3ur Jewelry.\u00a0\nI have created a line of copper and copper alloy jewelry that makes use of healing and environmentally sustainable metal.\u00a0I am\u00a0starting this campaign to bring awareness to the health benefits of copper and also scale this collection so that it will be available to the global community. My goal is to raise $10,000.\nAbout Arm\u00f3ur\nA perfect fusion of fashion and health, Arm\u00f3ur lives and functions as artfully-inspired copper and copper alloy adornment,\u00a0 Arm\u00f3ur is born out of the intense desire to bring awareness to the various health benefits of copper and transdermal micro-nutrition while also delivering totally stunning wearable art designs. Transdermal micro-nutrition is a process in which the copper metal reacts with the skin to create a bio-salt that is then absorbed through the skin.\u00a0\nThis reaction is important to distinguish because copper is a trace mineral that our body needs to function properly.\nAbout The Creator:\nAs an artist dedicated to my craft of design\u00a0and jewelry making,\u00a0I\u00a0have completed metalsmith, wax-working, casting, and digital design classes to enhance my work and design skills. I also have had my work featured in a short film entitled \"Not That Nice,\" about an artist who is learning to balance the call of her heart versus conforming to society.\nI am a multimedia artist, innovator, creator, and designer. I love to create art of all types using my voice, music, movement, and adornment. I have a passion and enthusiasm for health and improving the health of the global environment by making thought provoking pieces and making them beautiful and interesting enough to grab anyone's attention.\nSince 2017, I have been designing jewelry.\u00a0I started out making copper nose cuffs and ear cuffs for myself. Eventually, enough people began to ask if I sold them, and so many people expressed their admiration for my pieces that I decided to start a business. I secretly started the nose cuff trend with my copper nose cuffs. I had not seen them anywhere before I started making them.\n\u00a0\n\nWhat We Need To Launch This Collection\nMy Goal is to Raise $10,000 for this business in order to scale this collection, reach a global audience, and\u00a0trademark a process that I invented involving wax-working and prototyping designs.\nYour contribution will go toward:\nTrademarking fees\nLegal Consultation\nPatenting Fees\nAdministrative Fees\nRaw Materials\nMold Making of Prototypes\u00a0\n3-D Scans of Prototypes\nLaser Cutting and Casting Fees\nYouTube Channel Equipment To Teach About Copper Alloys and Jewelry Making\nAdspend to reach\u00a0customers who resonate with this work.\nYour Support Will Help To Make An Impact:\n\nArm\u00f3ur will help to bring awareness to the public on the various health benefits of copper and transdermal micro-nutrition. It is normal for copper, a healing precious metal, to produce a green reactive salt on the skin. Most people have a negative perception toward this process because of misinformation and misidentification of metals. However, this process is completely natural and healthy, and is called transdermal micro-nutrition, in which the metal reacts with the skin to create a bio-salt that is then absorbed through the skin. Additionally, copper is EPA classified as one of the only metals that is antimicrobial, antiviral, and can continuously kill viruses that it comes into contact with including the virus that causes COVID-19.\u00a0\nYou can read more about the antiviral effects of copper on the EPA's website: https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-registers-...\nThe use of copper material is deliberately chosen with our health in mind. Wearing copper can help to alleviate a variety of copper deficient ailments. Copper can help to alleviate pain in arthritis, improve cognitive function, and help with detoxification. In fact, many health-forward people buy copper jewelry for the healing, metaphysical, and energetic properties.\nCopper is Sustainable\nCopper is the world's most reusable resource. Sustainable mining practices and 100% recyclability add to the value and importance of copper. Worldwide, global resources are estimated to amount to 5.8 trillion pounds, which only about 0.7 trillion pounds (12%) have been mined throughout history. Nearly all of what has been mined is still in circulation. The ability to reuse copper extracted from recycled product is a tribute to the industry and preserves the use of natural resources.\nThe U.S. is completely self-sufficient in its production of copper and does not rely on foreign copper.\nCopper Alloys Used In This Collection:\nMy pieces are distinctively designed copper and copper alloy jewelry and adornment beneficial to humankind and the environment. My newest collection of pieces consist of ear cuffs and rings, electro-formed in copper, cast in bronze, and yellow and white brass.\n\nWays You Can Help\nYou Can Support The Launch of The Arm\u00f3ur Copper Alloy Collection By:\n\nDonating To The IndieGoGo Crowdfunding Campaign\u00a0\nSharing This Campaign With As Many People As You Can on Social Media\nFollow Arm\u00f3ur On IG: @artbyarmour\nBuy A Piece of Jewelry\nBecome a Member of My Website: www.artbyarmour.com\n\nContact me at info@artbyarmour.com\u00a0\n\n"

At our own expense with no additional funding we held inclusive festivals, conferences, competitions, etc., that included thousands of participants.Here\u2019s the info about our festivals:1. Our First International Inclusive Practices Festival \"PUSHING THE LIMITS - 2018\". These were exciting days! Amazing people, useful projects, unique performances:\n\n\u00a0\n2. Our International Inclusive Practices Festivals \"PUSHING THE LIMITS - 2019\" is a great site for internship for future psychologists, teachers, social workers, coaches and other practitioners working in inclusion.What We Need &amp; What You GetDuring the global pandemic, our Virtual Platform gained unprecedented success and in 2,5 months 5000 people became its active audience. IP Virtual Platform includes 35 sections, people from 17 countries, and hundreds of persons with disabilities that present their projects to the world. The interest in the platform is so high that we haven\u2019t got enough resources to accommodate and support all those who want to join. Today you can help a maximum number of persons with disabilities from Europe and USA to join our platform and learn to use all the benefits it offers.Inclusive Practices Virtual Platform (IPVP) is a virtual open space that brings together more than 500 inclusive initiatives in inclusive arts, sports, education and learning, volunteering, tourism, etc. At the heart of this project is an international community of social inclusion practitioners from Armenia, Belarus, Bulgaria, the UK, Germany, Georgia, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kenia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, the Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine. Every day, in livestream format, the IPVP presents discussions on relevant issues of inclusive practices, Zoom meetings, webinars, presentations, online competitions and events, documentaries and many more.How can you help?We are holding the Inclusive Practices without Limits competition that allows socially active persons with disabilities to compete for a main prize \u2013 a certificate for an internship program on the base of the IPVP. The certificates for the first group of interns were paid for by the IP, but there are more people who are interested in the internship, our program attracts more and more active people, and while the IP has human capital and technical capacity, we need for the certificates to be paid for. All the funds will be used to remunerate coaches\u2019 work and pay for the utilities, technical support and Internet promotion.That\u2019s why we ask for your help. One certificate costs 300 USD. One certificate is one month of intensive study. One certificate is a chance for one person with a disability to become successful and to find their purpose and place on the international Inclusive Practices Platform.With your help we can make more persons with disabilities successful. We invite you to become a participant of the development of an inclusive community without limits.Why do you need it?\nIn this project you can become a full-fledged participant in the development of an inclusive community without limits. By helping our project, wherever you live, you\u2019ll become a person of the World:\nYou\u2019ll be invited to take part in a discussion on the topic of inclusive community development;\nYou\u2019ll be a guest when the interns will present the outcomes of their studies;\nYou\u2019ll receive a thanks letter from the international Inclusive Practices Team;\nYou\u2019ll receive a newsletter that will allow you to follow the interns progress;\nWe\u2019ll talk about you in our social media:\nYou can become an official donor of one of the sections on the Inclusive Practices Virtual Platform.\n\u00a0We don\u2019t look just for sponsors, we develop an active community of those who care and are ready to be a part of the development of an inclusive community. We don\u2019t just ask for your money, we\u2019d like to engage strong and active persons who want to contribute to the good cause. Do not donate, if you don\u2019t share our views and you are not enthusiastic about it.The ImpactPlease, learn more about the successful projects that we had accomplished:The IP CompetitionThe first International Competition \u201cThe Best Inclusive Practices 2018\u201d encompassed various directions of social inclusion such as art therapy, inclusive sports, family inclusion, creative inclusive collectives, authorial projects. The purpose of the competition was information support and promotion of successful inclusive practices. The first prise in the competition was production of the full-time documentary about the winning project.The winner of the first International Competition \u201cThe Best Inclusive Practices 2018\u201d was the project \u201cFuture teacher \u2013 A child with special needs \u2013 Parents: the points of contact\u201d from Chernivtsi, Ukraine.The next competition was focused not only on successful, well established inclusive projects, but also on new, fledgling ideas and initiatives in social inclusion. That\u2019s why this competition we named \u201cInclusive Practices of the Future: Ideas, Research, Innovations\u201d.In 2019, the first prize was shared between two winners:\nElena Maslova from Minsk, Belarus, and her project \u201cInclusive practice in the organization of the choir collective as a system of development of communicative competence in students\u201d and\nZulfia Troska from Moscow, Russia, with her project \u201cThe school of inclusive volunteering\u201d.\nSocial inclusion is actively developing; new directions continuously emerge as well as new horizons open. One of the trends is inclusive community development.Our third International Inclusive Practices competition \u201cInclusive Community Leader 2020\u201d is dedicated to this topic. In line with the theme of the competition, the winner received a ticket to the World Community Development Conference 2021 (WCDC2021).Yulia Zherlitsina from Kyiv, Ukraine, a director of the Public Organization \u201cThe Hive of Ideas\u201d and the author of the project \u201cA Native Lullaby\u201d received an opportunity to present her experience in community development during the WCDC2021.We also held three very engaging marathons and we\u2019d like to tell about one of them:The II Inclusive Practices Marathon \u2018Inclusive Community: Here and Now\u2019 (IP-Marathon) took place on November 9-15 2020. The purpose of the IP-Marathon is to develop a remote discussion platform for exchange of experience in the area of inclusive initiatives as well as to provide information support for inclusive community development practitioners.817 participants from 9 countries (Armenia, Belarus, the UK, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Russia, Uzbekistan and Ukraine) took part in the IP-Marathon. Among the participants were practitioners, parents raising children with developmental challenges, inclusive community organizers and leaders, university professors and students, inclusive programs developers, heads of organizations and educational institutions.The IP-Marathon program included: presentations on successful inclusive practices experiences; authors\u2019 Zoom-seminars; online discussions on pressing issues in social inclusion; training sessions on inclusive community model visualization; photo exhibition \u2018Pushing the Limits \u2013 2020\u2019; inclusive flash mobs by the Children\u2019s Inclusive Community; brainstorms for practitioners in the inclusion area; inclusive online NON!SCHOOL; the finale of the international inclusive competition for school and university students \u2018Points of Contact\u2019; premiere of the video project \u2018Inclusive Culture in Society \u2013 the Magic of Touch and Glance\u2019; the main stages of the international competition \u2018Leader of inclusive community \u2013 2020\u2019.IP-Marathon became a platform for 77 speakers who gave speeches on various aspects of social inclusion: art therapy; inclusive education; inclusive theater; inclusive dances; inclusive creative teams; inclusive sports; inclusive tourism; alternative forms of inclusive creativity; inclusive communities/social associations; inclusive events; social inclusive initiatives; inclusive laboratories; digital and Internet technologies for inclusion.The overall broadcasting time of the IP-Marathon (from Monday to Sunday) was 57 hours. The main inclusive events were live streamed on Inclusive Practices\u2019 Facebook page and YouTube channel. During the week more than 30\u00a0000 viewers watched the recordings of these live streams.Risks &amp; ChallengesThe possibly most damaging situation \u2013 a global Covid-19 pandemic, has already happened. We are proud to say that we were not only able to survive the hard times, but we also took a step forward. We were able to make a modern world more ACCESSIBLE to the persons with disabilities. This is the fact. Now it\u2019s only a question how many people will be able to overcome the obstacles and enter an active social space.The only risk there is if the Internet would be down all over the world\u2026 but? We believe, Elon Musk promised not to let this happen.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you don\u2019t have the means to help us, we will help you and it\u2019s fine. If you personally know a person or persons with disabilities or volunteers, share our contacts with them and they will be able to join our inclusive community. We speak multiple languages and will be happy to lend our support to any person from any corner of the world.Our YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/c/INCLUSIVEPRACTICESOur Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/inclusivepracticesOur Instagram https://www.instagram.com/inclusive_practices/Our Telegram Channel https://t.me/inclusivepractices\u00a0\u00a0\u0418\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u0439\u0442\u0435 # ipVirtualPlatform \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0435\u0442\u044f\u0445\u0414\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0448\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043c \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0443 info@inclusivepractices.net+995579 215590 (WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram)\u00a0\u00a0"

There are several tumours in the left lung which have spread to the pleural cavity and central chest lymph node.\u201d\nThat was my news by\u00a0the consultant looking after me, after my first ever stay in hospital, on the 23rd of June this year. Below I will give you the full run down of my history and this appeal but for now, here are the main ideas\n\nI am going to sensibly try all options available to me to tackle this illness\nSome options require more financing than I can afford but I should try everything\nThis page is for anyone to help me trial every option, for which you will receive my unwaverong love and a wonderful blog to keep you informed of my progress :-)\u00a0\n\nWithout you, it would be rather a large mountain to climb. Climbing is always better in groups\n\nWhat We are Doing &amp; What we Need\nAfter spending much time researching and chatting with my Oncologist and local circle of experts, I have the following avenues to explore:\n\nLooking after myself. Low/no alcohol beverages and a great diet (look out for a new Alcohol Free beer in the neighbourhood)\nFollow the Oncologist treatments (Osimertinib/Apixoban/Omeprazole/Oxygen Therapy etc)\nUsing guidance from Herbalists, use recommended doses of THC (the expensive part)\u00a0\nKeep getting regular check-ups and feedback all information to friends, advisors and backers\n\n\nThe Impact\nI have never done a crowd funder before and publicly asking for financial help is quite a humbling experience. I have had a lot of help with setting this all up and given the legal implications understand this could be a rocky road and fully understand my actions. If it all goes to plan and I rid myself of this disease I will obviously be handing over everything I have done to the medical authorities to achieve my goal and cure myself of this cancer. If successful...\n\nI get to led a full and healthy life\nCreate a full case study for anyone you unfortunately are\u00a0in a similar position\nCampaign for the legalisation of medicinal THC in the UK\n\n\nRisks &amp; Challenges\nThe risks are that all of the above and below treatments are not going to work. The challenge will be to remain positive and open to all changes when they occur and also keep an eye out for more treatments and options\n\nI am a very positive person, this will be tested over the next few years.\nI will need my very best friends around me\n\n\nOther Ways You Can Help\nApart from any donations you can always help by being a good friend, staying in touch and sending love and best wishes at regular intervals!\nThe History part... (long read)\nAfter my night in hospital, the world froze and then shattered. In that split moment I thought.. What do we tell the kids? How long have I got? Can\u2019t I have a new set of lungs? Is this a joke and Jeremy Beadle will rise from the grave and burst through the doors? I wish my Dad was still alive. With the determination not to cry I turned round to see the blood drain from my loving wife\u2019s beautiful face, and then asked \u2018What happens next?\u2019\nWe returned home to the brewery and I told my business partner. We had a moment and he put me straight that this was now my priority and don\u2019t worry about the business, he\u2019s got that covered.\nI was assigned an Oncologist who I would meet in a week\u2019s time. The longest week of my life. I did all my crying, sleeping a lot. Telling the kids what had happened and accepting the fact I have cancer. This was also the weekend I \u201ccelebrated\u201d my 51st birthday, a rather muted affair and holding on to a secret I didn\u2019t know the magnitude of.\nThe day came where I met \u201cMy Doctor\u201d for the prognosis. Taking in every word like never before, I learnt about non small cell EGFR lung cancer. I was introduced to Osimertinib, the newest of inhibitor drug which has a good chance of working to stop the cancer growing for a while.\nHow long is difficult to guess, it depends how long my body can cope with taking it. There was a firm list of Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts in way of living life going forward - she told me I am not to consume any\u00a0alcohol. Obviously she had done a bit of research on me, which isn\u2019t difficult to do and allowed me 1 pint of beer a day if I have to, and they do not carry over! I was dependent on alcohol apparently, this was easier to cure than we thought, given the circumstances. And yes, there is our own version of alcohol free beer coming soon, however we now have a new obsession in my life that is currently present in my lung. Oh and \u201cif it spreads it will move to your brain which will mean radiotherapy and we will take your driving license off you forever\u201d another hammer blow. We will find this out through the scans.\u00a0\nI then learnt here about \u201cscanxiety\u201d a word I invented by our pal Les that describes the fear of going in the machines and then the wait for the results. You have no hiding place from a\u00a0few quick words to influence any outcome. This intelligent lady at the hospital holds all the cards and what a job to have. I few months later after the chemotherapy drugs had set in and my body is showing the results of a healthier lifestyle, I then decided I\u2019m not accepting the cancer death sentence.\u00a0\nI am going to get rid of it. Never underestimate the power of the positive mind. The body also produces its own chemicals through happiness and euphoria that fight the killer T cells. I am lucky to have some Gp\u2019s in my circle of friends that confirmed this. Even my oncologist agreed that this is the case, however there is no science to back this up so it can\u2019t be proved. Hereby lies the rub. Anything that has not been through the western medical classification system cannot be approved by the NHS, for sure I have seen a further GP and fully trained herbalist for a recommendation of natural remedies that will complement the Osimertinib and Apixoban and now Omeprazole(prescribed drugs) that wont conflict with the good work they are doing in keeping me alive.\nHopefully stopping the growth and spread of the cancerous cells. I have embarked on oxygen therapy at the Wessex MS center that involves being put in a hyperbaric chamber under 2 bar of pressure and breathing pure (98%)oxygen for an hour. This is a private course I am funding and also absorbing the 1 hour journey each way 2 to 3 times a week. My brewery partner has taken all this in his stride with extra work on his behalf and we are employing more staff to cover for my absence.\u00a0THC is widely seen as the work of snake oil salesmen by the majority of Doctors due to lack of evidence and results of extensive research, however I have read many reports and believe this is part of the cure. Procuring a bag of weed is no problem but not what I need. What I am after is specific dosage and percentage of milligrams of THC and produced in a laboratory. This can all be achieved if I choose to move country where this is not illegal . So I am faced with a dilemma. There is a lack of case studies due to it being illegal, there can not be any case studies due to the same reason, therefore there is no evidence and while we go round and round in circles. I haven\u2019t got time to change the law, campaign in parliament and all that goes with it. I do have access to Medical grade THC from the Czech Republic and procured outside of current British law. Some people think it is crazy to go public and disclose my intention to break the law, but this route is very costly and not available yet through our National Health System. This is not the time to get into that but in the coming months and years I\u2019m sure to share this with you all. If all goes to plan then I will be looking to join the campaign to change the law in Westminster, but for now I will climb one mountain at a time\u2026\nI am also embarking on various retreats and courses in the alternative medicine world. Prior to any of this I am doing my research and letting all the practitioners know of my current condition and pharmaceutical dependencies as these drugs from the mainstream medicine world. Don\u2019t forget these drugs are also at the forefront of medical research and I fully respect my Oncology team and all the people who dedicate their lives to this. However it is always easier to seek forgiveness than ask permission. I am having all my bodily functions regularly analyzed by the best in the country with blood tests, ECG\u2019s, CT,MRI and PET scans to plot my progress.\u00a0Thank you for taking the time to read this and if you chose to contribute then hopefully I will owe you the debt of gratitude in helping save my life. I will be setting up a blog to keep you up to date with the progress of all of the above with the help of my mystery digital mastermind currently in Canada\u2026.\n\u00a0\nLove and Peace\nT.C.A.G.P x\n"

The new pool, hot tub and deck will be seamlessly integrated into the existing historic building and grounds the \u00a0Scotia Lodge- incorporating our heritage trees, lawn, and architecture. Introducing this new concept to a century-old hotel will breathe new life into a long-cherished community gathering space.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We envision a Swim Club that hosts swim lessons, fitness classes, meetings, birthday parties, and quiet mornings by the pool. Humboldt County is a rural and remote part of California, with only one community pool. There is absolutely nothing like this in our region, and we believe this crowdfunding campaign will create a space for community health and wellness as well as an innovative venue for social and professional gatherings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have the designs and plans, but we need you to help\u00a0open\u00a0the Scotia Lodge Swim Club in 2022.\u00a0Won\u2019t you dive in with us?THE PLANSThe Swim Club will be located near what was once the World's Largest Redwood Mill, so it is only fitting that the entire sun deck be constructed of redwood. This local material matches the rest of the Lodge and is naturally mold resistant, which makes it ideal to use as a deck that surrounds a pool and hot tub. The pool and hot tub will be from Mod Pools which repurposes shipping containers. Each pool\u00a0houses it's\u00a0own heating system which makes them more efficient than traditional pools. We have submitted the plans and applied for the permit. To see our Phase 2 Plans, click here.THE HISTORY\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since its creation, \u00a0The Scotia Lodge has hosted locals and travelers from all around the world. Originally built in 1923 as The Mowatoc Hotel, the hotel was likened to a small-scale version of \u201cthe grand resort hotels of the national parks'' and served as a stagecoach stop between the Bay Area and Eureka. Later, it became the Scotia Inn and was a centerpiece of the region, hosting guests from all over the world, grand weddings, and holiday celebrations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Over the years, the Scotia Inn was neglected. In 2018, it closed its doors. Humboldt Social purchased the hotel from The Town of Scotia in early 2021 and has carefully restored the space while preserving its historic integrity, including the Craftsman-era woodwork and antique clawfoot tubs. We renamed the hotel the Scotia Lodge as a nod to the hotel's home in the heart of Redwood Country.The Scotia Lodge features 22 guest rooms, a grand lobby, ballroom, dining lounge, indoor and outdoor event spaces, and the Main + Mill restaurant and bar. Named after the intersection where the Lodge sits, Main + Mill serves classic road food (salads, burgers, and filling entrees) and craft Americana cocktails in its full bar. \u00a0It has never had a pool and with the addition of the swimming pool, hot tub, and sundeck (all connected to the outdoor lawn area), we will create the ultimate Humboldt hangout spot.THE PLACE\u00a0The Scotia Lodge is located in Scotia, California in Humboldt County, nestled among the redwoods that it was built from. We acknowledge and appreciate that the building is situated on the territory of the Sinkyu-ne (Sinkyone) Peoples. We believe that this land was called Tokenewolok by the Wiyot and Kahs-cho ken-tel-te by the Lolahnkok Sinkyone. We are grateful to be able to work on Sinkyu-ne lands and strive\u00a0to be good guests.Surrounded by the Avenue of the Giants and tucked into the banks of the Eel River, the town of \u00a0Scotia is the perfect spot to view the sunset over the Lost Coast mountain range. Scotia is close to the farms of Southern Humboldt where the climate is ideal for producing cannabis, wine and organic produce. It's location right off of \u00a0Highway 101 makes it a convenient location for those experiencing\u00a0the endless natural wonders of the Redwoods State and National Parks.THE TEAM\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Humboldt Social, we create hospitality spaces that connect travelers with our local community. We see crowdsourcing as an extension of that community building. Humboldt Social is a Humboldt-County based hospitality group. Co-Founders Amy and Jon O\u2019Connor lead the team behind two boutique hotels, waterfront cabins, and three restaurants and bars. Our design aesthetic highlights the history and beauty of the North Coast, with an emphasis on reclaimed materials, vintage furnishings, greenery, and lots of natural light. All of our spaces are designed to be welcoming and low-key retreats from daily life.

We curate authentic, integrated travel experiences that reflect the richness of our region. We are passionate about introducing our guests to Humboldt\u2019s unique resources- our redwoods, beaches, cannabis farms, and creative community. Our team loves living and working in Humboldt County, and has been an integral part of the restoration of each element of the Lodge. Other projects include the restoration of a World War II blimp base on the Samoa peninsula into the Humboldt Bay Social Club, and the creation of the Papa &amp; Barkley Social space in Eureka. The Scotia Lodge and the Scotia Lodge Swim Club is our most exciting project yet.THE PERKSWe have collaborated with some of our favorite local makers to bring you an exciting array of bespoke perks,\u00a0including advance purchase of daily pool passes, monthly and annual Swim Club Memberships.\u00a0We also have delicious experiences, fun swag, and limited edition items that will only available for a single day.\u00a0\u00a0These make the perfect Holiday gift to give! Upon the successful ending of the campaign, you will be emailed a\u00a0certificate to print and give to your loved ones, friends or co-workers. Due to supply chain challenges for some perks, the certificate will be redeemable when items are received. Give the gift of an experience and an investment in community connection.\u00a0\u00a0"

At the same time, we are already exploring other ways to fund our Swim Club vision. We are pursuing loans, investors and creative partnerships. We will squirrel away any profits we earn this year and next to build upon the funds raised by this campaign. We don't know for certain when the Swim Club will eventually open its doors, but we are committed to making it happen.\nOur business is rooted in a deep love for our community, and we can not tell you how much it means to us to have your support. Thank you for believing in us and taking a chance on our crazy idea. The past few years have been tough for our business and our families, and we know it's been hard on all of you as well. The fact even during a pandemic you took the time and energy to support this campaign is humbling beyond words.\u00a0 We take your faith in us very seriously, and we want to make you proud.\nWhen the campaign ends, we will begin mailing out perk orders- your certificates, tickets, swimsuits, and Pool Passes. Since we aren't certain when Opening Day for the Swim Club will be, we want to give you the opportunity to trade in your Pool Pass for another perk from the campaign. Or if you would prefer to hang on to your Pool Pass and redeem it when the Swim Club opens, that works too!\nIn the meantime, we will continue to post updates on the campaign's progress. We will also continue to send you secret invitations and discount codes to our backers to express our gratitude for having our back. We are so grateful to be part of this community with you.\n\u00a0\nThank you from the bottom of our hearts,\nHumboldt Social\n\u00a0"

The value of their currency plunged and eventually it became nearly impossible to import goods from other places. It has reached the level of a major humanitarian crisis in 2021 in which Lebanese people cannot even find aspirin and children are sick and dying from easily treatable maladies.\nThis is a great article if you're interested in how the situation\u00a0came about:\u00a0\u00a0https://www.thenation.com/article/world/lebanon-financial-collapse/\nI have always wanted to visit Lebanon. From childhood, when our closest family friend threw dinner parties with spreads of kibbeh, manaquish, and sublime Lebanese rice, with memories of his family and the intersection of cultures they came from, even to my adulthood when I tasted Lebanese wine and\u00a0wondered, \"how is this so beautiful?,\" visiting Lebanon has been a lifelong dream. And with my eyesight deteriorating rapidly, it is now or never.\nSadly, the economic situation has only worsened and the delta variant is tearing through the country. Cancellation seemed like the sensible\u00a0course of action. I didn't mind seeing a country when it's not at its best, but I also didn't want to be a burden on it.\nInspiration\nWhen I found out that one of my contacts in Beirut had been hospitalized with Covid, I began googling to find out what kind of care he would receive and what he might need. I came across articles and tweets of Lebanese showing how they stuffed their luggage full of critically needed items (e.g. https://observers.france24.com/en/middle-east/20210730-lebanon-medicine-shortage-expats-bring-home-medication)\u00a0when returning to the country. I realized I could do the same and repurpose my trip for something less self-serving.\nI am flying out of JFK on Wednesday with my bags full of medicines and personal care items. I have already spent about $3000 on OTC products and prescription medications shipped from a doctor (who is actually an angel) in California. I am working with the Osman family who've coordinated lists of needs from Ashraf Pharmacy in Beirut and from a pharmacist working with Doctors Without Borders in the Beqaa Valley to plan how best to use the remaining space. But some of these medications are very expensive: one is $15/pill and honestly I had no idea asthma inhalers were $400! So I'm asking your help in filling up my bags to save some lives.\nWe know it's not a longterm solution. But in the near term, I am a man with three suitcases, and there's no reason not to leverage this opportunity to ease some pain.\n\nWhat We\u00a0Need\nIt's pretty simple\n\nI am raising $10,000 to subsidize the actual medications and personal care items\nI need New York metro area doctors who can assist with prescriptions and procurement\nShare with anyone in your network who can contribute\n\nRisks\nThis isn't a low-risk endeavor, so I want to be candid about what some of the risks are and how we're managing them.\n\nTheft: always a risk with luggage. The strategy here is to put the valuable medicines in my hand-carried bags and use the luggage for things of lower value. I think this will be effective, and the fact is that antacids, anti-diarrheals, ibuprofen, antifungal creams, etc. are low value to thieves.\nCustoms: I feel somewhat confident in this area since I'm going to be among a hundred plus people who've done a very similar thing. I'm also receiving practical advice now from experienced medicine mules and I even have a few tricks up my sleeves from when my family lived in Egypt (like placing menstruation products on the top) that used to work great at getting us through.\nTransport: Ahmad Osman has volunteered to pick me up and get these items to the right people (as well as supporting me non-stop in planning for the last four days in spite of having just had surgery and being very busy--thank you!). He's already looking out for and preventing the dumb things that tourists like me can do coming out of an airport.\u00a0\nInsufficient Prescriptions to Buy What's Needed: This is our biggest risk currently, but the management of it is not difficult in the sense that we can still buy more OTC items or work with our Medicins sans Frontieres pharmacist to find another channel.\n\nUltimately, if some portion is stolen or confiscated, the sheer quantity we're bringing will more than offset it.\nHere's What You're Buying\nThis is a rapidly-evolving list but will give you a sense of what I'm taking. For the more expensive prescription drug items, our budget gets us around 10 courses of treatment for most. The OTC items have been purchased much larger bulk quantities to maximize luggage space.\n\nIbuprofen syrup (pediatric) x10\nAzithromycin (pediatric) x5\nantiemitic (adult) Domperidone or US equiv x5\nantiemitic (pediatric) Domperidone or US equiv x5\nantibacterial Cefixime (pediatric) x10\nantibacterial Cefixime (adults) x5\nAugmentin/amoxicillin (pediatric) x10\nAugmentin/amoxicillin (adults) x5\nVoltaren or US equiv x10\nCiprofloxacin (adult) x10\nTopical corticosteroid cream x10\nTopical antibacterial cream x10\nantifungal (adult) Daktarin or US equiv (monistat) x10\nantifungal (pediatric) Daktarin or other oral gel/oral cream can be used in infants x10\nProbitiotic for pediatric with diarrahea x10\nRelvar inhalers x10 (2 so far)\nRamipril 10mg x10\nMoxonidine or US equiv\nClopidogrel 75mg x10 (have 360ct so far)\nMetronidazole syrup or US equiv x10\nAcetaminophen/Ibuprofen combo pain reliever (4x bulk bottles)\nMultivitamin male x10 (or equiv in bulk bottles)\nMultivitamin female x10 (or equiv in bulk bottles)\nMultivitamin generic (or equiv in bulk bottles)\nMultivitamin pediatric x10 (or equiv in bulk)\nOmeprazole 20mg (x10)\nAcetaminophen otc x3 bulk bottles\ncough drops (adult or ped) x4 bulk pouches\nFirst aid kits\nBand aids\nSleep aids\nVitamid C\nadult probiotic\nanti-diarrheal otc\nmelatonin 5mg\nvitamin d3 50mg\nfish oil supplements\nmenstruation products\nanti-allergy adult\nanti-allergy pediatric\nbatteries\nnutrition bars\nhigh-protein snack\nsmall individually wrapped sweet for kids\n\n"

In some cases, we are getting recipeints' names to put on the bottles. For the remainder of the prescription meds, we are obtaining them under the name of the receiving pharmacists since they are the only ones ultimately qualified to know to whom they can go."

I am hoping to continue this project in some capacity after I return. I believe if it can be done in partnership with MSF and sites like MedsForLebanon, a much better system could be set up to deliver these items continuously. In the short term, it was important to me not to miss the opportunity to fill three empty suitcases, so that's the scope of this effort."

Additionally, there is a large Google doc spreadsheet we are using to track every request, estimated cost, actual cost, as well as keep an image of each receipt.

I spent nearly four weeks in Istanbul after I left Beirut, and ai made one final med run at the end when I realized I could procure something that was much needed cheaply from a Turkish pharmacy. Needless to say, most of my time was spent enjoying the company of friends and making several new ones. It was a fantastic experience and both med runs went off without a hitch.\nI am now left with the items which did not fit in the suitcases after our massive re-packing efforts. Shockingly, only about 20% of the items were left in NYC; and they are almost entirely preventative and personal care items. The plan is to mail all remaining meds and then decide (based on the price of mailing a box) whether the best destination for the remaining items is Beirut or a local charity. I'll continue to update until everything has been allotted.\nHere is what remains:\n\nThank you again to everyone who supported this project."

Healing Harmony is a holistic healing practice providing individual and group sound healing treatments, workshops, and retreats.\u00a0You can support Healing Harmony right now by choosing a PERK below!Sound healing is a gentle, non-invasive holistic healing practice which has been scientifically proven to reduce stress and anxiety, ease depression and grief, and mitigate trauma.\u00a0 For millennia, societies around the world have been using the many methods of vibrational healing to improve physical, mental, and spiritual health.\u00a0Funds from this campaign will help propel\u00a0Healing Harmony to the next level, and allow me to\u00a0introduce this unique path to wellness, and\u00a0provide sound healing to as many people as possible.\u00a0I will use your contribution to purchase equipment, attend training for continued education, and\u00a0provide free or low\u00a0cost group healing sessions to non-profits, and people who are unable to access, or find relief, from other healing treatments, such as those who are incarcerated or recovering from trauma.\u00a0Healing Harmony employs metal singing bowls handcrafted with intention in Nepal. These singing bowls are placed on or around the body and played by striking or rubbing the bowls to produce sound.\u00a0 Healing sound vibrates our physical bodies at the cellular level to act as a deep tissue sonic massage.\u00a0 It also heals in an auditory capacity by changing our brain patterns,\u00a0resetting our \u201cfight or flight\u201d response, and restoring us to a natural state of harmony and balance.Doesn\u2019t that sound great?Healing Harmony was created with profound intention. It is the culmination of my life-long career as a singer, my professional training as a musician, decades of meditation practice, hundreds of public performances, certification in the use of singing bowls for sound healing, and most recently, specific training in the creation of sound and vocal toning for visualized meditation and journey. This healing practice is is also the result of my profound\u00a0healing journey through stress, anxiety, sexual violence, trauma, surgery, pain, and recovery.\u00a0The health and wellness industries have been devastated during quarantine, and the realities of living during the time of a pandemic.\u00a0 In many ways it was not an ideal time to start a sound healing business!\u00a0 However, the world needs healing, and I sincerely believe in boosting our collective vibrations so that we are all healthier, happier people, who desire to lift others up rather than tear them down.Please visit\u00a0https://www.healingharmonyllc.org/for more information.\u00a0 And if you know someone who might be interested in sound healing and could benefit from this transformational experience, please forward this campaign!\u00a0"

            "story": "\nI grew up with ADHD in a time when it wasn\u2019t understood, I had a hard time in life. It wasn\u2019t until my late 20\u2019s that I discovered belly breathing. This effective technique had a profound effect on me personally and helped lead me to where I am today.\u00a0 As a mother, yoga teacher and mindfulness instructor, I spend a lot of time working with children who have difficulties with attention, whether from anxiety, trauma, depression, or attention deficit disorders.\u00a0 Often calming is necessary for the class and individuals to function. Since I have personally experienced the benefits of belly breathing, I have shared this with my students, including my own children, with impressive results.\u00a0 It was tricky figuring out how to teach children the abstract concept of diaphragmatic breathing to children, while keeping them engaged long enough to experience the benefits. That\u2019s when I created BellieBuddies!\nBellieBuddies are little plush toys, designed to ergonomically fit on a child\u2019s belly. They were designed with weighted tummies to provide bio-feedback, are tall enough to be seen while lying down, and are wide enough to prevent falling off.\u00a0 BellieBuddies are a fun and simple way to teach breath to kids so it actually makes sense to them. Breathing with a BellieBuddie is like playing a fun game with your breath. This keeps kids engaged long enough to experience some of the benefits, such as relaxation, balance, mood stabilization, and stress release. Using classical conditioning principals, children relate BellieBuddie breathing to feelings of wellbeing.\u00a0 This activates the reward centers in the brain, making them want to do it again and again, triggering these positive effects.\u00a0 We all know that when we do things repetitively, we condition ourselves to have an automatic response.\u00a0 Imagine if you could help your children learn to have an automatic response of relaxation, instead of stress or anxiety.\u00a0 I know this is possible, as I have seen it work with many of my students!\u00a0 That is why I created BellieBuddies.\nI am asking for your help.\u00a0 The first stage, the design and production of the first BellieBuddie, Sakhe, the dolphin, is complete. The money from this campaign will be used for the second phase which is the creation of companion books, training videos for educators, downloadable meditations, stories, and mindfulness videos for kids. If we go over our goal we will use those funds for stage 3 which is more animal designs, website resources, and advertising strategy.\u00a0 The sooner we get the BellieBuddie project funded, the more families we can serve by introducing them to the benefits of belly breathing and mindfulness.\nWe are asking you to purchase a \u2018raw\u2019 BellieBuddie, meaning just the plush toy without the companion book or training videos, which are still under development, pending the success of this funding effort.\u00a0 When you purchase your BellieBuddie today, you will receive your very own Sakhe, the dolphin within 4 weeks.\nWe are confident that we will reach our goal of selling 1,200 BellieBuddies. However, if we do not, we will use the money we do raise to further develop the full BellieBuddie concept, with the meditation downloads and training videos first on our list.\u00a0 We appreciate your help and support and would LOVE to see you with Sahke, the dolphin in your home. Thank you.\nPlease consider helping BellieBuddies reach our goal by sharing campaign on Social media.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"

(I supposed to launch on GoFundMe, but they don't support for Japanese citizen.)On the 17th of May 2017, I got a high fever and passed out at work. A few days later, my knee started swelling aggressively and I had to stay in the hospital straight away. I was diagnosed with a malignant tumor which name is \u201cUndifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma\u201d, incidence rate is 1/100,000.In July of that year, sarcoma has been removed, After some months of chemotherapy, but still had possibilities of metastasis and recurrence.

We hope to empower sufferers of food allergies to be able to make more informed decisions about what they eat, no matter where and what they are eating.\nOur idea stemmed from the headlined, shocking stories in the news recently of food allergy suffers dying after consuming products from high-street cafes, which were incorrectly labelled. After seeing these stories we knew that something had to change; this terrible mistake could easily reoccur and have an equally devastating result. So, we have created My Allergy ID, an app which will eradicate this problem and massively aid both consumers and eateries, which we are in collaboration with, when it comes to food allergens.\nWe would really appreciate your help and funding as, with this our app has the potential to save lives and change the way food-allergy sufferers eat forever.\n\nWhat We Need &amp; What You Get\nWe hope to raise \u00a3500 and with this we can work to\u00a0further developing our app\u00a0.\u00a0We as a company do not need \u00a3500 pounds so we will be donating a quarter\u00a0of the money we raise to The Anaphylaxis Campaign. This is charity solely focused on supporting people at risk of severe allergic reactions, which is exactly the group of people we hope to support. Your funds would help us to launch\u00a0our app as soon as possible, before this error could be made again and another life could be taken due to a easily-made mistake.\n\nThe Impact\nIt is clear to see what a huge impact our app could have on, not only the UK, but in time the world at large. This is going to change the way food-allergen sufferers eat forever - with security and comfort. I am sure if you, yourself, either suffer from food-allergies or know someone who does, you will know what a massive burden this can be for some people and what major precautions they need to take. This app will be so valuable to the world and the catering industry, because of its promotion of ease, convenience but most importantly safety.\n\nRisks &amp; Challenges\nDue to our age, we have little expertise in approaching larger businesses in the catering sector. This is a step we need to take to generate awareness and also to start to amke our way into larger highstreet chain stores, where it will have the most impact. We have already generated great interest from a few one-store cafes and plan to trail our app here as soon as it is launched. To overcome this we have contacted a particular highstreet cafe for guidance and advice on approaching larger businesses, which has been really valuable and helpful.\nWe are aware that creating an app has its risks due to the nature of it being a huge success or just a flop. However, we really believe in what we have created and we have no doubt that it has the potential to become a huge success and one day something that people will struggle to consider not having. We are prepared to take this risk due to such strong belief that it could change the catering industry and the way people eat forever.\n\nOther Ways You Can Help\nIf contributing is not an option for you, there are many other ways you can help us. Something we are focusing on at the moment is getting the word out and raising awareness of our app and this campaign. This is a key element and any support in anyway would be hugely appreciated. So please share our campaign on social media by using Indiegogo share tools because we believe our app has the potential to save lives and to the mass it provides the security and safety when buying food, that is missing in the industry at present.\n"

For pre-order we will be offering perks for supporters of an adorably chubby version of a classic Teddy Bear, Chonky Bear and a selection of 4 different Sensory Packs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chonky Bear is a premium super-soft plush Bear built to be durable while remaining soft and breathable.\u00a0The bear is 16\" in height so large enough for adults as well as children, but able to be condensed for traveling by removing packs.\u00a0\u00a0The back of Chonky Bear features a hidden zippered enclosure to add multiple Sensory Packs. The enclosure is double-lined to support up to 8 lbs of weight.\u00a0\u00a0Each Sensory Pack is designed to be soft and cuddlable within your Chonker but has a different feel, weight, or effect that makes it unique. All packs are easily removable and can be used alone or with any other pack.\u00a0\u00a0There will be 4 different Sensory Packs to choose from at launch: Weight, Heat, Heat + Lavender, and Plush. You can include up to 2 packs at once to add up to 8 lbs of weight or to combine effects like heat and weight.\u00a0\u00a0Adding weight allows you to take advantage of a therapeutic technique known as deep touch stimulation, a \u00a0method of adding concentrated pressure to the body to calm the nervous system and promote relaxation. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This technique has become popular among Occupational Therapists and in hospitals as a natural method to calm anxiety. The weight provides a sensation of security much like you experience from cuddling, receiving a hug, or a child being swaddled. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each weighted pack is 4 lbs and each Chonker can hold 2 packs at a time. There is no particular perfect weight for everybody as it is largely a matter of preference and can change over time as you acclimate to the sensation; however, between plush, heat, and weighted packs you can go from 1 lb to 8 lbs in seconds to find the perfect weight for you.Heat Sensory Packs allow you to warm up your Chonker to take advantage of the soothing physical and mental benefits of Heat Therapy. Pop your Heat Sensory Pack in the microwave for 1 minute and it will remain warm for over 2 hours within your Chonker. Add it to the freezer for 2 hours and it will stay cool for an hour. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying heat to areas of your body can naturally soothe and improve the flow of oxygen through your blood stream. \u00a0The improved blood flow is why heat packs have been popular for so long when sick or recovering from an injury, or dealing with cramps as it increases the extensibility of collagen tissues, decreasing joint stiffness, pain and relieving muscles in a post-acute phase of healing while increasing the flow of proteins, nutrients, and oxygen to the affected area.The Heat packs are also able to be cooled to help with pain management and general comfort. \u00a0Like using ice packs or ice baths, cold is great for recovery by reducing blood flow to a particular area of your body you can help reduce inflammation and pain.There is nothing worse than trying to sleep through hot, sticky summer nights, CHONKERS are the \"cool side of the pillow\" that will stay cooler longer. Beyond just comfort, the temperature can be very helpful as soothing sensory input for calming panic attacks, over-stimulation, or anger episodes.The Heat + Lavender Sensory Packs have the same effects as the Heat Pack but with \u00a0the additional benefit of Lavender added.\u00a0Using scents as a relaxation aid has been used for ages and is known as Aromatherapy. Aromatherapy is simply the use of scents to trigger a reaction from your mind. The connections that your mind makes to particular scents can trigger this without you even knowing. Adding naturally calming scents like Lavender stimulates relaxing responses from your brain's limbic system. This works very similar to using a relaxing scented candle, a bubble bath, a sleep spray, essential oils, or sleeping with comforting smell of a loved ones sweatshirt to help you calm down or sleep better.The Plush Sensory Pack allows you to fluff up your Chonker while adding minimal weight. \u00a0The plush pack is similar to a traditional teddy bear with a cushy soft feel that still plumps up his belly depending on how stuffed you want him while continuing to allow you to control the weight.\u00a0\u00a0The TeamOur team of designers and product experts has been working with occupational therapists to create new sensory products for people with anxiety, depression, autism/ASD, and other disorders for 5 years.\u00a0Personally, throughout my life I have lived with social and generalized anxiety and sought methods to help manage it. In Kindergarten, I used to cut off a small piece of my favorite blanket to keep in my pocket to help me calm me down but have continued to create for effective options in the years since. In 2015, I discovered how the effects of deep pressure could help me calm down and began trying weighted blankets which were popular in the ASD community at the time. While I found them helpful, I also found them to be expensive, bulky, hot, and primarily made in child sizes.I started making my own versions of these blankets to improve them working closely with others using the products and Occupational Therapists to create more affordable and accessible options, eventually founding a company to produce high-quality sensory bedding in 2016. Weighted blankets grew in popularity and became cheaper and better quality, but the inspiration for Chonkers came while still looking for ways to improve on some of the challenges customers and I continued to face like overheating, portability, price, and finding/adapting to the perfect weight even 5 years later.The solution ended up not being bedding at all but a stuffed animal that could utilize more natural occupational therapy techniques and be personalized to the individual. Chonkers can be used everyday, traveled with, and was more effective. Chonkers is a product that I love and am excited about the opportunity to share with the world."

Her excitement for sharing this passion with others, coupled with a desire for knowledge in health and fitness\u00a0has grown stronger each day.\nSway wants to create an impact in the community. She wants to show people that they can be healthy and gain results through simple practices.\n\u00a0\nDamian Mark has been a professional chef in private restaurants, country clubs, and hotels for the last 18 years. He has worked all over the United States and spent\u00a0time in Europe honing his craft. He loves food, is passionate about of cooking, and most of all he loves to teach.\u00a0\nSoturi Fitness and Nutrition\u00a0will be a community within a community \u2014 a place to practice physical fitness, nutrition and mindful health, in\u00a0California's Silicon Valley. Creating this facility means we can work with more people to create a larger impact on health in the community.\nThe Soturi Fitness and Nutrition studio\u00a0will provide a comprehensive wellness experience, without fad\u00a0diets\u00a0or fad workout plans. We will offer a variety of fitness classes and health related workshops because we trust in the power of continuing education. Our coaches and fellow members will provide accountability and encouragement for each other.\u00a0\nWe believe it's never too late\u00a0to set\u00a0foundations for a healthy lifestyle but we also believe it's easier when you start early so we encourage whole family participation in this journey.\u00a0\nWith your help\u00a0we can get the gym up and running faster and begin changing lives sooner!\n\u00a0\n\nWhat We Need &amp; What It Is For\nWe are looking to raise $50,000 on Indiegogo (while at the same time applying for a SBA loan). We want to get started as soon as possible!\nThe funds raised\u00a0will help us:\n\nAdd\u00a0a communal kitchen space.\nPurchase a portion\u00a0of the equipment needed.\nHelp with continued education with our coaches to better serve the community.\u00a0\nCreate programs for community outreach.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nBelow is a rough sketch of our functional movement layout:\n\u200b\nWhat if we don't reach our goal?\nWe will still use the funds for the above purposes. We are determined to build this facility no matter what!\n\nHow we are different than other gyms!\n\n\nCommunal kitchen space - \nMembers are encouraged to use this space before and\u00a0after their workouts (or anytime) to prepare healthy food.\u00a0\nScheduled cooking workshops to teach the community how to shop, prep, and cook healthy meals efficiently.\u00a0\nCommunity cooking and dinner\u00a0events (including food drive and volunteering events).\n\n\nWe see our members as individuals.\u00a0Since no two people are the same, we aim to help people reach their goals in ways that are\u00a0suitable to their lifestyle.\n\nWe understand and emphasize the importance of a balanced\u00a0lifestyle -\nWe encourage members to take a variety of classes, the yin and the yang.\u00a0\nWe don't neglect recovery - including healthy eating and rest.\nWe partner with a world-renowned nutrition coaching program powered by Nutrition Precision.\u00a0\nThat doesn't mean we don't have fun! We still love ice cream and chocolates;\u00a0we just enjoy them more mindfully and\u00a0in moderation.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nBelow is our class schedule for when we open:\n\n\n\nWe are actively involved with community programs, such as non-profits and schools.\u00a0\n\nFunHouse Kids -\nA kids care program to genuinely engage your child with structured classes so they can share the love of a healthy life.\nSchedules will include -\nSTEM (science, technology, engineering, and math)\nCooking\nFunFood Factor\nArts and crafts\nDance\nKids fitness\nKids obstacle course\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Impact\nIn addition to the many who seek a healthier life, there is an epidemic of an overweight, and unhappy people in the United States. Many of our youth are not taught the importance of nutrition and healthy living in school or at home and they grow up without a foundation in health. At Soturi Fitness and Nutrition, we are working to empower the community through proper tools and information to live healthier lives. Education and empowerment are our best weapons to support those looking to create healthier lives for themselves and their families.\nSoturi Fitness and Nutrition will be working with organizations to\u00a0help kids live\u00a0healthier, but that is only the beginning. \u00a0We have big dreams (including starting our own health and nutrition foundation\u00a0and working with a wide variety of non-profits) to reach\u00a0a wider population and make sure kids are supported too!\nWe need\u00a0to be kinder to ourselves and to the world. And by doing so, we can all make this world a better place.\n\u00a0\n\nRisks &amp; Challenges\nWe are determined to build this gym! We are in the process of applying for a SBA loan, and the funds raised here will help us build the entire gym the way we envision thus making a bigger impact, instead of scaling it down and taking longer to reach the wider community as we hope to do.\u00a0\nCheck out our website at SoturiFitnessAndNutrition.com\n\u00a0\n\nOther Ways You Can Help\nWe understand that you may not be able to contribute financially, but there are definitely other ways you can help us share our mission!\n\nUse the Indiegogo share tools on the top right to share on\u00a0social media - Facebook / Instagram / Twitter.\nTalk about Soturi Fitness and Nutrition with your friends, family, co-workers, teachers, students, bartenders, servers,\u00a0cab drivers, mailman, milkman, exes, and newspaper delivery kids (if they still exist!)\n\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT!"

Instead of stepping on a scale that tells you your combined body fat, now we can see exactly how much fat we are losing and where, or exactly how much muscle we are gaining and where! WOWZA!If any of you would like to come by and try it out just give me a holler and we'll set up a time to measure you!Thank you again for your contribution and encouragement!Love &amp; Happiness,Sway"
